 {"id":72, "title":"MOD ANNOUNCEMENT - Changes (past, present and future) to r/AskWomen", "content":"Some of you may have noticed that some things changed around the sub over the last couple months. Others are still changing, and going forward we\u2019d like to make sure the community is all on the same page regarding how the mod team runs the sub and what our goals are (it\u2019s all for you, after all).  Our mod team went through some changes: one of our most active mods, u/nevertruly, decided to step down, and will be sorely missed. Over more than a decade modding the sub she\u2019s been more than just incredibly good at it; she\u2019s been a true role model to the rest of the team. Her dedication, integrity, and excellence has set a standard that inspired us all. There were other departures as well, and we want to thank the admins for their support in helping us navigate this transition. These changes have brought clarity and renewed passion to the team, and we're looking ahead with a stronger sense of direction and alignment.  Moving on to changes made to the sub itself, Thersday is now back to its original format. A few years back, by popular demand, we made it so every Thursday was a day where all questions needed to focus on our users exclusively, without mentioning their relationships (romantic or platonic) to any other people. We collectively felt that it became too restrictive, and so it has now reverted to a day where we don't permit questions centered on men. In the same spirit, the sub is no longer tagged NSFW - while posts can still approach Not Safe For Work topics, the tag is not applied to all posts like it was before. NSFW threads will be moderated as usual, and creeping on our users will never be tolerated.  We realize that some of our rules are unnecessarily prolific, and some are confusing to users, mostly regarding gray areas and nuances. This is due to the fact that our rules have continued to slowly evolve over the years, and so has the platform and the community.  We're currently going through a full review of how the rules are presented and enforced. We're not planning any drastic changes, but you can expect the sub to become a little more relaxed and the rules to become more organized.  On a lighter note, now that the sub is no longer tagged NSFW, our current banner stopped making sense. We'd love to hear from you (yes, you), what would you like to see up there? One of our mods is a graphic designer and will have the time of her life screening through ideas and putting something together in collaboration with the community, so please leave a comment with your artsy thoughts!  As passionate and dedicated as the mod team is, there are now fewer of us while the sub continues to grow (there are over 5.5 million of us!), which means a new Mod Recruitment cycle is being planned for the near (very near) future. Stay tuned for the official announcement with requirements, expectations, perks, and details on how to apply.   And last but not least, the mod team would like to thank you all for your participation. We're all volunteers here, so no one's paying us shit to say or do any of this. We're putting in the work every day because we love this sub, and we want to see it thrive and become a place that's as enjoyable and valuable for you all as it is for us.  Thank you!  -The r/AskWomen Mod Team", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1jrk0pl/mod_announcement_changes_past_present_and_future/", "date":"2025-04-04", "image_url":"None", "gender":"askwomen", "sentiment":"neutral"},

An apology and a promise to do better doesn't really cut it, when it's a continuous state that doesn't go away. But what are the perimeters of that? I guess everyone will have their own line. E.g. if your partner and you are furnishing your new place, and they go out and buy crockery, but they don't color match the mugs and the plates, is that weaponized incompetence? (Is it incompetence?)  I saw a post about how British people don't wash suds off their plates. I always thought it was strange when people don't do that. If you ask someone to do the dishes and they leave the suds on, is that (weaponized) incompetence? Does it change if they are British?

 {"id":1012, "title":"Those of you who cut adult friendships in your 30s due to your own stupidity and ego, how did you deal with it?", "content":"TL:DR - I (31M) walked away from a long-time friend group after a conflict, and now I\u2019m torn between regret and self-respect. I know friendships are harder to build after 30 and I might\u2019ve lost my only social circle, but staying meant tolerating subtle bullying, being disrespected, and constantly feeling like an outsider. I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t truly be there for me in tough times, and I don\u2019t feel I had much to offer in return. Now I\u2019m left with a confusing mix of guilt, relief, loneliness, and resentment\u2014and I don\u2019t know how to deal with it.  *Long post ahead*  I got into an argument with a group of friends on WhatsApp yesterday and decided to leave the group, stating that I wouldn\u2019t be joining the trip due to unavoidable commitments. Now, I feel petty, immature, and miserable. At the same time, I believe my actions were valid\u2014I don\u2019t like being walked over. Some of the same people in the group had bullied me 10\u201312 years ago, and I refuse to go through that again.  I've realized that my absence likely won\u2019t make a difference to them. Most members of the group are close with each other, and I\u2019ve never really been part of that inner circle. The truth is, I don\u2019t have another friend circle to fall back on. The fear of not having friends, of not socializing or going out, often pushes me to stay connected with them\u2014even when it takes a toll on my mental health. I constantly feel like I have to choose between preserving my peace of mind or staying socially active in the hope of becoming a better, more socially adept person.  I don\u2019t have a great career, immense wealth, good looks, or a magnetic personality. Compared to my peers in the group, I often feel below average. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t deserve basic respect.  One of the members, in particular, is treated like a god\u2014put on a pedestal, admired blindly, and allowed to dictate others' choices. I hate it. He was one of the people who bullied me in college. Even today, he belittles me, laughs at my struggles, and everyone just goes along with it. He might have everything\u2014looks, intelligence, wealth, and experiences\u2014but that doesn\u2019t justify being worshipped or allowed to bulldoze over others.  I know that getting offended can be seen as a sign of weakness, and that a strong person handles conflict with grace and calm. I feel guilty for not being that person. I\u2019m ashamed that I haven\u2019t built a life where I\u2019m valued. But just because I don\u2019t have the best career, the most money, or the most charm doesn\u2019t mean I should be disrespected.  Sure, friendly teasing is part of any friendship\u2014I get that. But I can\u2019t stand the toxic dynamic that\u2019s formed, where power and popularity seem to excuse bad behavior. In the end, I had a choice: respect myself and walk away, or stay and continue to be mocked, bossed around, and humiliated. I walked away. And while I know I lack the emotional maturity and social circle I wish I had, I\u2019m trying. I've always struggled with forming and maintaining friendships, and I don\u2019t know the right way to fix that. But I do know I deserve better than being treated like I don\u2019t matter.  I know that forming new friendships after 30 can be incredibly difficult, and that the friendships we have at this stage in life are often ones we\u2019re expected to treasure. That\u2019s why a part of me feels like I made a mistake by walking away. At the same time, I also feel like I finally respected myself by doing so.  I\u2019m aware that things will never be the same between me and the group. I\u2019ll likely miss out on shared moments, fun trips, and the comfort of having a social circle to fall back on. I\u2019ll probably feel lonelier now. But the truth is, I\u2019m also certain that if I were ever in real trouble or going through a tough time, none of them would truly show up for me. I\u2019ve always felt like I had very little to offer them, and it\u2019s hard to ignore the feeling that many of these friendships are transactional.  Now I\u2019m left with this confusing mix of emotions\u2014regret, relief, fear, and resentment\u2014and I genuinely don\u2019t know how to navigate it. It feels like I\u2019m mourning something that maybe never even fully existed, and I\u2019m not sure how to make peace with that.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1jwg7be/those_of_you_who_cut_adult_friendships_in_your/", "date":"2025-04-11", "image_url":"None", "gender":"askmen", "sentiment":"negative"},

I (25m) wanted to come here, present my struggles, and just see if anyone can truly relate, is where I am or has been where I currently am.  As I\u2019ve grown, done therapy, paid attention to my feelings towards others, I\u2019ve come to realize that I have an incredibly transactional, apathetic mind in how I relate to the world. Almost everything I do is driven off of \u201chow does this benefit me.\u201d I feel as though I don\u2019t truly connect with others emotionally, but rather just see other people as only valuable to me when they are directly serving me or validating me in some way. When I am alone, I have little to no desire to reach out to friends or family, I constantly spiral about how I might just be \u201cbroken\u201d and am unsure if I need to fight it or just accept. I\u2019ve done a lot of work to decrease my need for external validation and have made incredible strides, but now, without that need, my brain goes \u201calright well if we don\u2019t need that anymore, why would I ever care for others. I don\u2019t see how that would benefit me.\u201d  Example: Someone I knew (f) was discussing politics, and told me that in the most recent election, \u201cwomen\u2019s bodily rights and autonomy were under attack\u201d and all I felt was \u201cokay, that has nothing to do with me, so I don\u2019t care and I don\u2019t see how I\u2019d benefit from caring.\u201d Even when I try an empathy building exercise and flip the script on this (imagine my bodily rights attempting to be taken away), I even struggle to understand why others who are unaffected would care for me in that situation.   I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m broken, insecure, just simply don\u2019t experience empathy the way others do, need help or need to just accept, etc. I\u2019m just so lost.

 {"id":1115, "title":"Men, why is male dysmorphia running rampant amongst us nowadays?", "content":"I asked an AI app a question about male body dysmorphia, as well as masculinity, this is what I got. What's your thoughts about this, and do you agree or disagree with the results?  You've hit on some complex and sensitive issues. Here's a breakdown:  **Detrimental Aspects of Natural Body Hair:**  * **Social Stigma:**     * In a society that increasingly values smooth, hairless bodies, natural body hair can be seen as \"unclean,\" \"unattractive,\" or \"unrefined.\"     * This can lead to social judgment and feelings of insecurity. * **Body Image Anxiety:**     * Men may feel self-conscious about their body hair, comparing themselves to idealized images in media and pornography.     * This can negatively impact self-esteem and mental well-being. * **Perceived Lack of Grooming:**     * In certain social circles, natural body hair may be seen as a sign of laziness or lack of self-care.  **Lack of Casual Nudity and Masculinity:**  * **Reduced Body Familiarity:**     * Casual nudity in communal settings (like locker rooms) fosters a sense of familiarity with the male body.     * The lack of this exposure can lead to increased anxieties and insecurities. * **Diminished Sense of Community:**     * Shared experiences of nudity can create a sense of camaraderie and bonding among men.     * The absence of this experience can contribute to feelings of isolation and a lack of masculine affirmation. * **Lack of defining affirmation:**     * The lack of casual nudity, removes a normal form of exposure to other male bodies, and removes a normal form of exposure to the wide range of male body types. This lack of exposure can cause men to have a skewed view of what is normal, and therefore cause insecurities.  **Team Sports, Military, and Social Acceptance:**  * **Shared Experience and Camaraderie:**     * Team sports and military service create intense shared experiences, fostering strong bonds among men.     * Nudity becomes normalized in these environments, as it's a practical necessity in locker rooms and communal showers. * **Physicality and Masculinity:**     * These environments often emphasize physicality and strength, which are traditionally associated with masculinity.     * Physical displays of affection (hugging, high-fives, etc.) are seen as expressions of camaraderie and support, rather than sexual advances. * **Hierarchical Structures:**     * The Military has a very defined hierarchical structure, that defines what is and is not acceptable. Within that structure, those acts of physical affection are deemed acceptable, and therefore are. * **Social Context:**     * The social context in which these behaviors occur is crucial. In a sports or military setting, they are seen as normal and acceptable.     * Outside of these contexts, the same behaviors might be misinterpreted.  **In essence:**  * Social norms and cultural context play a significant role in how male nudity and physical affection are perceived. * Team sports and military service create environments where these behaviors are normalized and accepted. * Outside of these contexts, anxieties and misinterpretations can arise. * The lack of casual nudity in modern society, has caused a decline in defining affirmations of normal male bodies.  **Suffering from Lack of Affirmation:**  * **Body Image Issues:**     * Yes, the lack of exposure to diverse male bodies can lead to increased body image anxieties.     * Men may feel insecure about their own bodies, comparing themselves to unrealistic ideals. * **Social Isolation:**     * The decline in communal nudity can contribute to feelings of isolation and a lack of connection with other men.     * This can impact mental and emotional well-being. * **Confusion about Masculinity:**     * The absence of clear, natural examples of masculinity can lead to confusion and uncertainty about what it means to be a man.  **Desire for Experience and Lack of Opportunity:**  * **Suppressed Desires:**     * It's likely that some men do desire the camaraderie and body acceptance that comes with casual nudity.     * However, they may not know how to create those experiences outside of traditional settings. * **Lack of Social Spaces:**     * Modern society offers fewer opportunities for casual male nudity.     * This limits men's ability to experience this form of bonding and affirmation.  **Decline in Knowledge of Natural Masculinity:**  * **Shifting Definitions:**     * Yes, there's a decline in understanding of traditional, natural masculinity.     * This is due to evolving societal norms and the influence of media and culture. * **Confusion and Uncertainty:**     * Men may struggle to define their own masculinity in a society with conflicting messages.     * This can lead to confusion and a sense of lost identity.  **Toxic vs. Natural Masculinity:**  * **Natural Masculinity:**     * Encompasses positive traits like strength, courage, and resilience.     * It values emotional vulnerability, empathy, and respect for others.     * It is the natural expression of maleness. * **Toxic Masculinity:**     * Emphasizes dominance, aggression, and suppression of emotions.     * It promotes harmful behaviors like violence, misogyny, and homophobia.     * It is an over exaggerated and negative form of masculinity. * **Connection to the Issue:**     * The lack of natural defining affirmations of male bodies, can cause men to seek out other forms of affirmation. This can cause men to seek out the negative forms of affirmation that are found within toxic masculinity.  **In essence:**  * The decline in communal nudity and the confusion about masculinity are negatively impacting men. * Many men are likely seeking experiences of affirmation but lack the opportunities. * The lack of natural masculine affirmation, can cause men to gravitate to toxic masculinity.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1juwtaa/men_why_is_male_dysmorphia_running_rampant/", "date":"2025-04-09", "image_url":"None", "gender":"askmen", "sentiment":"negative"},

My dad retired last year which he had been really looking forward to. However, I'm a bit worried about him as he seems to have very few hobbies to fill his time, and those that he does have are solitary, or involves doomscrolling / shouting at the news etc.  Could you guys suggest some hobby ideas for him please? Ideally ones that might get him out of the house and socialising with other people and making new friends. Some more info about him:  - he is based in a small seaside town in the UK (eg not a big city, so things like meet-up groups are limited) - Enjoys gardening (one of his current hobbies, esp in the spring & summer) - Enjoys LEGO (pretty sure he's spending my inheritance on this!!). It's great, but it's obviously a solitary hobby - he's not got any real friends that I can think of. He tags along with my mum to things, but he doesn't have any of his own friends atm - he's not super 'well' atm, and has some medical issues meaning breathing issues and back pain. This means most sports / active hobbies are a no-go, and anything requiring hard physical labour. Even standing for periods of time will be difficult. - he's a recovering alcoholic so anything too reliant on booze won't work - he enjoys watching cycling races - he loves a pub quiz - problem is that he has no friends to go with - he's a great cook and baker, although doesn't do that very often these days. I thought he was getting into jam making for a while, and sourdough too, but that seems to have fallen by the wayside.  I am thinking of suggesting he finds a language course (he used to be fairly good at French), perhaps volunteering with a local scout group, or maybe at a local museum.  Thoughts much appreciated!  Edit: you guys have some awesome hobbies, so thank you for sharing ideas with me! My dad will have no free time left if he takes up all of them ha! There\u2019s so many I never would have thought of that I could see him enjoying, so will start slowly mentioning a few to him to see what sort of reaction they get.

On one occasion, she waited for me, called out to me, and when I didn\u2019t stop, she followed me. She also made an attempt to give me candies. At first, I took them, thinking it was just a friendly gesture, but it now feels like she\u2019s trying to engage me in a way I\u2019m not comfortable with.  At the start, I used to smile back when she smiled at me, but that was just because I\u2019m generally friendly and smile at everyone. It wasn\u2019t an indication that I like her or want anything more than a professional relationship. I\u2019ve made it clear by not responding to her advances or showing any interest, and I\u2019ve told her I have a girlfriend, but it still doesn\u2019t stop.  I feel like I\u2019m in an uncomfortable situation because she\u2019s always sitting directly in front of me, and I can\u2019t avoid making eye contact, which feels like I\u2019m being forced to engage.  I\u2019ve never had to deal with something like this before, and I\u2019m unsure whether I should address it directly with her or if I should escalate it. I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m overreacting, but I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I feel like I\u2019ve been respectful, and yet she continues this behavior. I\u2019m worried that if I don\u2019t do something soon, it\u2019ll keep happening and I\u2019ll be more uncomfortable.  What would you recommend in this situation? How can I get her to respect my boundaries without escalating things unnecessarily? I\u2019d really appreciate any advice or similar experiences.

I\u2019ve been married to my husband (37M) for just over 10 years and I\u2019ve always had a tender, father-daughter type of connection with my husband\u2019s dad. He\u2019s calm, present, and carries a kind of gentle, emotional safety I didn\u2019t grow up with. My own father was very abusive\u2014physically and emotionally. At one point he broke several of my bones during violent episodes. Because of that, I grew up deeply confused about love, affection, and trust\u2014especially when it came to men in father-type roles.  After doing a lot of trauma healing, I\u2019ve recently reconnected with my FIL in a way that feels peaceful and mutual. It\u2019s been grounding for me to experience a safe, healthy male presence, especially in a paternal role.  I wrote him a heartfelt card\u2014not emotional overload, just a warm, faith-rooted message of appreciation\u2014thanking him for being someone I quietly admire, and for showing up in ways that have been quietly healing for me. It\u2019s sincere, spiritual, and framed with respect.  My question is: If your daughter-in-law gave you a card like this, would you receive it well? Or would it feel too heavy or strange, given the non-biological relationship?  My intention is pure, and there\u2019s no emotional demand attached to it. I\u2019m just finally in a place where I want to honor that relationship\u2014but I\u2019m also very aware of how sensitive some men can be to receiving emotional expression.  Thanks in advance for your insights.  TL;DR Grew up with an abusive father (physically and emotionally), so trusting paternal love has been a lifelong healing journey. Recently reconnected with my kind, gentle FIL who\u2019s felt like a safe father figure. I wrote him a sincere, Christ-centered card thanking him for being that presence. Wondering how father-in-laws would feel receiving something like this\u2014would it be meaningful, or possibly too much?  I\u2019d like to add that my husband is fully supportive of this!    UPDATE: I\u2019m going to give it to him this weekend!!  Just wanted to thank everyone who responded with kindness and support. Your words gave me the peace and clarity I needed. I\u2019ll be giving my FIL the letter this weekend, and I feel really good about it now. Truly grateful for this little corner of the internet.   UPDATE PT 2******** I gave him the card and a few hours later he messaged me this really long and elaborate message about how I was the daughter he feels blessed to have and how he treasures how I love his son and his grandkids \ud83d\ude2d he was very grateful for the card and ended it with so much warmth and affection.

At the time, I was looking at the Navy or Coast Guard but I\u2019m now leaning more towards the army or marines. I ended up not joining more out of pride than anything else, as all my friends went to college and my parents were disappointed about me bombing school.   I ended going to community college, got into NYU, and majored in journalism. I graduated in 2023 and that career has not panned out as I\u2019ve wanted and I\u2019m quite bitter about the job market, to the point where I\u2019m looking at becoming a cop due to high pay and pension in my city. The only thing is I want to leave. I really haven\u2019t done much with my life or traveled and would love too. My question is: is this decision worth it? I feel old af and sometimes think I should have done this at 18.   Physical health: At 18, I was 5\u201911  and 180 and did a lot of rowing. I was fit.

So how can I push  through those thoughts, I made the changes to fix the problems in my life. It took more than a decade.

What's making life difficult for you?", "content":"TL;DR - If you're a man 18-35, I'm curious to know what the biggest challenge you face is. I think many people don't really ever hear about the challenges young men face, nor do young men talk about as openly. Both could be helpful in shedding light on this topic.     Some context on me:  About 10 years ago, when I was 22, I thought I was a f\\*cking loser. I was 22, had no degree, was just fired from my job, and was sleeping on my sister\u2019s couch. I had been wrestling with the feeling of having had spent so much of my life being angry and blaming my parents (really anybody) for every little perceived \u201cbad thing\u201d that had happened to me. I broke down one afternoon when all the emotions these thoughts evoked hit me. During this breakdown I found the bottom of that depression I was slowly sinking into for months.     I wiped  away my tears after beginning to process that wave of emotions that humbled me. I promised myself that I would take accountability for my life; that I myself was going to pull myself out of the hole I found myself in; that I was going to start forgiving and stop blaming other people (especially my parents) for where I was in life; that I was going to change my lived circumstances by getting out of the passenger seat and living idly. And though I didn\u2019t become a healed and enlightened multi-millionaire these past 10 years, I did build a life that I\u2019m damn proud of. It\u2019s a normal upper middle-class life (cost of living adjusted), but I don\u2019t hold onto that pain anymore. I don\u2019t blame my parents for all the bad sh\\*t that had happened to me growing up. I developed my skills and worked my way up from an entry level contractor role with a 3 month contract to a full-time Sr. Marketing Manager at a technology company in the Bay Area. This isn\u2019t said to brag. I\u2019m still finding my way like everyone else.     **Purpose behind my question:**  I know there are a lot of young men out there today who feel hopeless and helpless like I did on that day, young men who are slowly sinking and finding their own personal bottoms. Likely to be suffering in silence, desperate to find some sort of answer that will help them find their way. I want to help them. And though I\u2019m no guru, that doesn\u2019t prevent me from trying to do my part to help those whose circumstances are quite similar to where my journey began. I want to share my passion for personal development through written and visual content on topics that are relevant and matter to this age group. I want to share some of the valuable lessons I've learned along the way in the hopes that it may help someone else who's seeking information to help themselves find their own.   Like the poet Big Sean, said, \u201ceverybody needs direction even if it\u2019s to find themselves\u201d.\u00a0     **Question:**   **So, M18-35, what's the biggest challenge you're facing these days**? Not only is it good to speak it aloud, it's good to see that you're not alone in this journey; there are so many people on this planet who are going through similar challenges. And sadly a lot of people ignore the plight that we face in becoming men, so at the minimum maybe it could help shed light that this does exist.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1johfgl/m1835_whats_the_biggest_challenge_you_face_whats/", "date":"2025-03-31", "image_url":"None", "gender":"askmen", "sentiment":"neutral"},

I havent worn shorts in years. Im not happy with my legs (muscle mass) and have had various ongoing injuries over the years including one really bad one right now. And then I also broke my toe at the start of the year so I obviously couldn\u2019t train legs for that period (did leg extensions and hamstring stuff as this is ok with a broken toe, but still lost a little size in my calves, not huge but still plays on my mind)I hit and do legs as hard and as much as I can but given the pain Im in 24/7 I just cant train them as hard and make the same progress in my upper body. They\u2019re definitely not twig legs but not something Im happy with, not yet. So my upper body is more muscular than my lower. That being said im never full satisfied with my upper body either. I would hate to think people would think Im a leg day skipper when this is simply so not true and I want solid legs more than anything. Anyway to compensate, I always wear long pants, looser ones too. And I wear loose t shirts. I live in Australia so its always pretty hot and people are always asking why Im in long pants, friends give me a bit of shit how im never in shorts and I know family probably thinking why is he always wearing long pants even in the heat. I know my girlfriend also wishes I would wear shorts sometimes, and I do understand that. Sometimes this makes me a bit self conscious. Anyway cut to the chase, im going away with some mates for a weekend. Of course I will wear long pants while they probably all wear shorts and they will say dude its so hot why are you wearing long pants again, its fine though I usually just say its what I like. But the real problem for me is the beach. My long pants are not coming off but I can also hardly wear long pants to the beach\u2026right\u2026? I mean even I admit I would probably look silly. (No I wouldn\u2019t be swimming anyway) whats the alternative, do I make an excuse to stay at the apartment while the rest of them go and say I feel sick or something? The beach is one place I wouldn\u2019t really have an excuse not to wear shorts, from their perspective anyway.

Sometimes I wish we had that kind of old-school determination to work through challenges and build something lasting in relationships. It seems like my generation has a hard time committing to make things work, even when it comes to something that could be really great.

It seems my son is battling greatly with independence and wanting to feel in control as well as maybe trying to find his voice? So he is exhibiting similar behaviors as his dad. I feel as if my son does not respect me, he has detached himself from me but remains close to his sister. He's been having behavior issues at school, including cussing teachers out. He does not seem to care about consequences and I usually do not resort to punishment first but im running low on steam. How do I get through to this kid? How do I make him feel connected to the family unit again so that he's not acting out? I've offered counseling, we have tried having conversations but sometimes his comprehension is not what was said and he gets overwhelmed woth anger/frustration which gets us arguing in circles. He's also always super concerned about WHO is right...any advice is greatly appreciated.  EDIT TO ADD: He has a stepfather in his life that is VERY patient and responsible, calm, etc. He does not involve in punishments/consequences because his dad is still involved and we were deliberatelytold he should not be involved in THAT aspect by a therapist earlier on-his bio dad is just inconsistent in behavior and not a super positive male role model. He does play football during the fall for school but is not really interested in any other sports/activity other than gaming..which he plays madden of course. I always encourage his sports and am at every game. I am VERY adamant about being there for my kids events. His sister does have autism so she does require extra time for therapy and group.

CONTEXT; I (25F) have been going on periodic dates (w/ a 29M) for a few months now and it\u2019s obvious to us both that we are exclusively dating, but I have not yet introduced him to my family because I am waiting for him to officially ask or declare that we are in fact a couple and not just dating.   To me this has always been a very distinct difference. While I do date exclusively one person at any given time I still don\u2019t equate it to being in a \u201cpartnership relationship\u201d. I am Catholic, and I know that he is also coming from religious upbringing so I feel that we may be on the same page about it, but I was talking with a friend who has the same religious upbringing that my guy does, and my friend informed me that he has been dating his lady friend for about six months and he would not ask her to be his girlfriend because it simply is known. He said that given the dedication that they have for each other announcing it is a bit silly at this point.  This sort of blew my mind, but it made me wonder; Given the way that relationship dynamics have changed over the years- despite both of us having a traditional mindset and upbringing- maybe this is just the nature of dating nowadays, and because i want him to ask/declare it, then i will have to explicitly let him know that this is my standard.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1jm5mqk/howwhen_do_you_draw_the_line_between_just_dating/", "date":"2025-03-28", "image_url":"None", "gender":"askmen", "sentiment":"neutral"},

I come from a family mostly women and was married to one for a long time. As much as I tried I feel like my mother has always disregarded allowing me to develop into who I want to be, rather for who she wants me to be. Being vulnerable has always gotten me threatened by her or cast away to a school counselor because she didnt have the capacity to deal with my adolescent depression.   Fast forward 20 years and a failed marriage. Mom and I have never had a connection outside of the fact that she raised me and I am her son. So I initiated the conversation by opening up to her about wanting to leave my marriage. Rather than understand that I have my reasons and I wouldnt make a decision this lightly as I raised two children into young adults (16 and 19) on my own dime and ambition to give them better than I had. So she tells me I cant leave and to work it out. This would be good advice except the person I was married to and am divorcing has always been a brick wall. In short I feel like my mom has never seen me for who I am and just sees what she wants and disregards what I say as if Im not mentally capable of making a sound decision.   My kids mother I remember there was a time when I was young and coming up in life building our life financially, I would confide in her about the stressed I was dealing with regarding the pressure I felt to be a good provider and not feeling like I was being taken seriously in the workforce. Her response to this as a stay at home mom would be \"oh I knew you had a problem with me not working, why dont you just say it\". She'd make it about her. This same ritual with me being vulnerable and her making it about her went on for years until I shutdown and just censored what I'd tell her. She would even project onto me that I was the negative stereotype of men, dont listen, big ego and think women are supposed to march to the beat of my drum.   Do any of you feel like despite being your authentic self, that women dont believe you are who you present to be and its just not an act to get over on them? For context Im the type of person who doesnt really want anything from anyone but the respect that I show them. Hell I was on my litterly and figurativelty on my last leg with my marriage (was temporarily crippled from an accident) and I used the settlement money and cosigned for my exes car and never wanted anything in return. For me it was my investment in my kids future whether her or I worked out or not. I dont want my kids riding public transit, let alone her as a women having to care for them.   Also yes, I am in therapy working through all of the above.

And also please refrain from the \"man, fuck what people think, bro. You do you!\" advice that it seems men get a lot when they post about not liking gender roles. I understand that statistically there will always be some women that are attracted to me in the way I want and want the same relationship dynamics I do. My question is more just about how likely me finding that is, and overall I'd just sort of like an acknowledgement of \"Yeah, these dynamics exist and they suck, and you deserve to be able to find what you want one day!\" I don't necessarily want solutions or advice, I more so just want to be consoled delicately a bit. But, some advice is welcome if you feel the same way and have found workarounds.  Okay, now that I've got that out of the way, onto the meat of the post:  I(20m) am starting to have a realization as I come to age and begin possibly looking into jumping into the very scary an unsure world of dating, and that's that I don't actually think current gender roles and dating dynamics really allow me to be happy at all in a heterosexual relationship. I know that's a pretty crazy statement to make(maybe not if you spend any time on this sub or it's sister subreddits haha), but I can't help but feel that way when I examine generally how people expect relationships to work and the different way people treat men's desire to be desired vs women's. I'm bi, and obviously don't fit with any of the ideas of how men should \"be\", either in my physical appearance or my general desires.  And as I genuinely ask myself what I want in a relationship and what I'd need to be happy, I realize that a huge desire of mine and reason to even be in a relationship in a first place is so I could be\u00a0**desired,**\u00a0and not just desired in a sweet wholesome way(although don't get it wrong, I certainly want that, too), but also for\u00a0**my body.**\u00a0I want whomever I end up with one way to primarily want to have sex with me because they find my body physically attractive. Not because they want to connect more, or because they think my personality is so nice or that I'm so interesting or whatever, I want it to be a physical desire! I understand that this is shallow and vain, but I don't think that makes it wrong. Plus, people seem to understand good and well that it's okay to want to be desired for your body when women say it. It seems like whenever men say something like this people are quick to tell him that it isn't realistic to want this and he should just be satisfied ot have sex in the first place, but it seems like society in general is ore accepting of the notion that being desired physically is important to women, why isn't the same true for men? I know the answer to that question is gender roles, but it still sucks, y'know?  So many of the things I want to do in my hypothetical relationship aren't really things that men get to do. I want to show of my body with lingerie and sexy clothing, send alluring pictures of myself, wear revealing clothing and make myself pretty. And I want a partner that wants me to do those thing, not just someone that tolerates it or finds it endearing because they love me, as cute as that would be. Not to mention things that aren't so much related ro physical desire but relationship desire. Things like being proposed to, being asked out, given flowers. I know all these things do happen to men in heterosexual relationships, but it is far outside the norm and wanting a relationship with those dynamics seems kinda hopeless.  If you look at most subreddits, the difference in the sorts of answers men and women get on these topics are staggering. It seems pretty common that if a man posts about feeling undesired by his wife or gf, people are really quick to say \"Well, women have responsive desire so you shouldn't expect her to initiate sex\", \"Well, what are you doing to turn her on? Women aren't visually stimulated, y'know.\", \"How much chores do you do/do you get her flowers?\" But when a woman posts the same things about her husband people are quick to say that her desires are valid and she deserves to have a relationship where she is desired in the way she wants.

Ive noticed several men in my life gravitate and be unwilling to let go of women that e.g. refuse to work and earn an income, live by the rule that a man should work and pay for home, holidays, meals out, nights out, they often complain that they both need to buy a property together really early on (she always has not enough in the bank to get a small 5% deposit) and they expect gifts ranging in the thousands. And guys just do it and oblige. These guys occasionally lament on how they have no similar interests and their wife or gf hates their gaming or their friends and they willingly oblige to remove their own hobbies or interests out of their lives to satiate these women. So i dont get it, you dont have anything to talk about and when i ask them what they do together its often just going out for meals and him booking and paying 100% for holidays that she goes along for as she burns through his finances. But they just accepted this as their fate...  Im not a man and im not one of these women but ive seen more guys opt for the, as i call it, megan markles of the world, i watch as these women get a leg up in life, gain the luxuries they never had as they did not want to pursue a career with more money and they proceed to marry and then divorce after 4 or 5 years with her leaving with half his property and superannuation and him vocalizing all of this, the fact he never actually knew her beyond surface level...only at the end. Why do these men do this to themselves? Is the fear of being alone worse than blindly obliging to a life with someone who has no intention of embracing and loving the real you and holding you up with them to build your dreams and aspirations?

 {"id":1853, "title":"Rebuilding my social circle after years of isolation - how to overcome the awkwardness?", "content":"I (26M) haven't had real friends since I was about 15. After that, I moved around a lot, changed schools frequently, and never developed deeper connections beyond acquaintances I'd occasionally talk to.  I'm extremely introverted, which makes small talk and forming friendships challenging. I don't enjoy typical social activities like clubbing or partying that seem to be how most people connect. My interests are mostly reading books, working out, and boxing/MMA - not exactly the most social hobbies. Without much social practice over the years, I feel awkward and unsure of myself in most interactions.  After a lot of hard work, I had managed to get a nice paying tech job and was there for about a year before getting laid off last month. It was a remote position, and some of the other new hires who started with me were extremely social, party types. I tried to make friends and hang out with them, but it was just too overwhelming and honestly, I didn't really like them. That experience made me question if I'm just not cut out for friendships.  Recently, two potential friendship opportunities have come up:  1. I joined an MMA/boxing gym (one of my longtime interests). I'm trying to be more outgoing there - speaking up more rather than just nodding along silently like I usually do. It feels unnatural, but I'm trying. 2. A friend from middle school just reached out saying he moved back to the area and wants to reconnect. Looking at his social media, he seems very outgoing with an active social life. I'm worried I'll come across as boring or awkward compared to his other friends.  I genuinely want to build meaningful friendships, but after so many years of isolation, I feel like I've forgotten how. For those who've been in similar situations:  * How do you overcome the awkwardness of putting yourself out there? * What are some low-pressure ways to connect with people that don't involve typical party scenes? * Any advice for reconnecting with old friends when you've become very different people?

It\u2019s hard to describe exactly, but it\u2019s kind of like a mix of copper\u2014like pennies or metal\u2014and maybe a faint hint of freshly cut onions. It\u2019s not constant, just something I pick up on occasionally. I know this might sound odd, and I\u2019m not trying to say anything rude or weird here\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about hygiene or anything like that. The women I\u2019ve noticed it around aren\u2019t \u2018smelly\u2019 in any obvious way; it\u2019s more like this subtle, specific scent that feels consistent to me, almost like it\u2019s coming from something deeper.  I\u2019ve always been curious about it and wondered if I might have some kind of quirky ability\u2014like maybe I\u2019m picking up on illness, pheromones, or something biological that others don\u2019t notice. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s even a thing, but it\u2019s crossed my mind. So, I figured I\u2019d throw this out there to see if any other guys (or anyone, really) have experienced something similar. Have you ever noticed a faint, metallic, onion-like smell around certain people? Is this just me, or could there be something to it? I\u2019m genuinely curious to hear your thoughts.   Also, when I ask the women, do you smell that? They are literally oblivious.   I think it's important to note, that I smell the same smell on different women.  Update: I appreciate the feedback \u2014 what spurred this question was my curiosity about whether the faint, metallic, onion-like smell I\u2019ve noticed around certain women could possibly relate to my family\u2019s cancer history on the women\u2019s side, given studies on smelling illness. However, based on your responses, it seems I\u2019m likely picking up on an oncoming or active menstrual cycle.... I\u2019m a bit disappointed I don\u2019t have a superpower.

Unbeknownst to me, in many places in Iceland, they require you to shower in the buff in a big open room with a bunch of other dudes.   Was very uncomfortable doing this at the time and nearly just left. Ended up gritting my teeth and got the nerve to do it since I wanted to swim in the lagoons.
