 {"id":72, "title":"MOD ANNOUNCEMENT - Changes (past, present and future) to r/AskWomen", "content":"Some of you may have noticed that some things changed around the sub over the last couple months. Others are still changing, and going forward we\u2019d like to make sure the community is all on the same page regarding how the mod team runs the sub and what our goals are (it\u2019s all for you, after all).  Our mod team went through some changes: one of our most active mods, u/nevertruly, decided to step down, and will be sorely missed. Over more than a decade modding the sub she\u2019s been more than just incredibly good at it; she\u2019s been a true role model to the rest of the team. Her dedication, integrity, and excellence has set a standard that inspired us all. There were other departures as well, and we want to thank the admins for their support in helping us navigate this transition. These changes have brought clarity and renewed passion to the team, and we're looking ahead with a stronger sense of direction and alignment.  Moving on to changes made to the sub itself, Thersday is now back to its original format. A few years back, by popular demand, we made it so every Thursday was a day where all questions needed to focus on our users exclusively, without mentioning their relationships (romantic or platonic) to any other people. We collectively felt that it became too restrictive, and so it has now reverted to a day where we don't permit questions centered on men. In the same spirit, the sub is no longer tagged NSFW - while posts can still approach Not Safe For Work topics, the tag is not applied to all posts like it was before. NSFW threads will be moderated as usual, and creeping on our users will never be tolerated.  We realize that some of our rules are unnecessarily prolific, and some are confusing to users, mostly regarding gray areas and nuances. This is due to the fact that our rules have continued to slowly evolve over the years, and so has the platform and the community.  We're currently going through a full review of how the rules are presented and enforced. We're not planning any drastic changes, but you can expect the sub to become a little more relaxed and the rules to become more organized.  On a lighter note, now that the sub is no longer tagged NSFW, our current banner stopped making sense. We'd love to hear from you (yes, you), what would you like to see up there? One of our mods is a graphic designer and will have the time of her life screening through ideas and putting something together in collaboration with the community, so please leave a comment with your artsy thoughts!  As passionate and dedicated as the mod team is, there are now fewer of us while the sub continues to grow (there are over 5.5 million of us!), which means a new Mod Recruitment cycle is being planned for the near (very near) future. Stay tuned for the official announcement with requirements, expectations, perks, and details on how to apply.   And last but not least, the mod team would like to thank you all for your participation. We're all volunteers here, so no one's paying us shit to say or do any of this. We're putting in the work every day because we love this sub, and we want to see it thrive and become a place that's as enjoyable and valuable for you all as it is for us.  Thank you!  -The r/AskWomen Mod Team", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1jrk0pl/mod_announcement_changes_past_present_and_future/", "date":"2025-04-04", "image_url":"None", "gender":"askwomen", "sentiment":"neutral"},

An apology and a promise to do better doesn't really cut it, when it's a continuous state that doesn't go away. But what are the perimeters of that? I guess everyone will have their own line. E.g. if your partner and you are furnishing your new place, and they go out and buy crockery, but they don't color match the mugs and the plates, is that weaponized incompetence? (Is it incompetence?)  I saw a post about how British people don't wash suds off their plates. I always thought it was strange when people don't do that. If you ask someone to do the dishes and they leave the suds on, is that (weaponized) incompetence? Does it change if they are British?

 {"id":1012, "title":"Those of you who cut adult friendships in your 30s due to your own stupidity and ego, how did you deal with it?", "content":"TL:DR - I (31M) walked away from a long-time friend group after a conflict, and now I\u2019m torn between regret and self-respect. I know friendships are harder to build after 30 and I might\u2019ve lost my only social circle, but staying meant tolerating subtle bullying, being disrespected, and constantly feeling like an outsider. I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t truly be there for me in tough times, and I don\u2019t feel I had much to offer in return. Now I\u2019m left with a confusing mix of guilt, relief, loneliness, and resentment\u2014and I don\u2019t know how to deal with it.  *Long post ahead*  I got into an argument with a group of friends on WhatsApp yesterday and decided to leave the group, stating that I wouldn\u2019t be joining the trip due to unavoidable commitments. Now, I feel petty, immature, and miserable. At the same time, I believe my actions were valid\u2014I don\u2019t like being walked over. Some of the same people in the group had bullied me 10\u201312 years ago, and I refuse to go through that again.  I've realized that my absence likely won\u2019t make a difference to them. Most members of the group are close with each other, and I\u2019ve never really been part of that inner circle. The truth is, I don\u2019t have another friend circle to fall back on. The fear of not having friends, of not socializing or going out, often pushes me to stay connected with them\u2014even when it takes a toll on my mental health. I constantly feel like I have to choose between preserving my peace of mind or staying socially active in the hope of becoming a better, more socially adept person.  I don\u2019t have a great career, immense wealth, good looks, or a magnetic personality. Compared to my peers in the group, I often feel below average. But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t deserve basic respect.  One of the members, in particular, is treated like a god\u2014put on a pedestal, admired blindly, and allowed to dictate others' choices. I hate it. He was one of the people who bullied me in college. Even today, he belittles me, laughs at my struggles, and everyone just goes along with it. He might have everything\u2014looks, intelligence, wealth, and experiences\u2014but that doesn\u2019t justify being worshipped or allowed to bulldoze over others.  I know that getting offended can be seen as a sign of weakness, and that a strong person handles conflict with grace and calm. I feel guilty for not being that person. I\u2019m ashamed that I haven\u2019t built a life where I\u2019m valued. But just because I don\u2019t have the best career, the most money, or the most charm doesn\u2019t mean I should be disrespected.  Sure, friendly teasing is part of any friendship\u2014I get that. But I can\u2019t stand the toxic dynamic that\u2019s formed, where power and popularity seem to excuse bad behavior. In the end, I had a choice: respect myself and walk away, or stay and continue to be mocked, bossed around, and humiliated. I walked away. And while I know I lack the emotional maturity and social circle I wish I had, I\u2019m trying. I've always struggled with forming and maintaining friendships, and I don\u2019t know the right way to fix that. But I do know I deserve better than being treated like I don\u2019t matter.  I know that forming new friendships after 30 can be incredibly difficult, and that the friendships we have at this stage in life are often ones we\u2019re expected to treasure. That\u2019s why a part of me feels like I made a mistake by walking away. At the same time, I also feel like I finally respected myself by doing so.  I\u2019m aware that things will never be the same between me and the group. I\u2019ll likely miss out on shared moments, fun trips, and the comfort of having a social circle to fall back on. I\u2019ll probably feel lonelier now. But the truth is, I\u2019m also certain that if I were ever in real trouble or going through a tough time, none of them would truly show up for me. I\u2019ve always felt like I had very little to offer them, and it\u2019s hard to ignore the feeling that many of these friendships are transactional.  Now I\u2019m left with this confusing mix of emotions\u2014regret, relief, fear, and resentment\u2014and I genuinely don\u2019t know how to navigate it. It feels like I\u2019m mourning something that maybe never even fully existed, and I\u2019m not sure how to make peace with that.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1jwg7be/those_of_you_who_cut_adult_friendships_in_your/", "date":"2025-04-11", "image_url":"None", "gender":"askmen", "sentiment":"negative"},

I (25m) wanted to come here, present my struggles, and just see if anyone can truly relate, is where I am or has been where I currently am.  As I\u2019ve grown, done therapy, paid attention to my feelings towards others, I\u2019ve come to realize that I have an incredibly transactional, apathetic mind in how I relate to the world. Almost everything I do is driven off of \u201chow does this benefit me.\u201d I feel as though I don\u2019t truly connect with others emotionally, but rather just see other people as only valuable to me when they are directly serving me or validating me in some way. When I am alone, I have little to no desire to reach out to friends or family, I constantly spiral about how I might just be \u201cbroken\u201d and am unsure if I need to fight it or just accept. I\u2019ve done a lot of work to decrease my need for external validation and have made incredible strides, but now, without that need, my brain goes \u201calright well if we don\u2019t need that anymore, why would I ever care for others. I don\u2019t see how that would benefit me.\u201d  Example: Someone I knew (f) was discussing politics, and told me that in the most recent election, \u201cwomen\u2019s bodily rights and autonomy were under attack\u201d and all I felt was \u201cokay, that has nothing to do with me, so I don\u2019t care and I don\u2019t see how I\u2019d benefit from caring.\u201d Even when I try an empathy building exercise and flip the script on this (imagine my bodily rights attempting to be taken away), I even struggle to understand why others who are unaffected would care for me in that situation.   I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m broken, insecure, just simply don\u2019t experience empathy the way others do, need help or need to just accept, etc. I\u2019m just so lost.

 {"id":1115, "title":"Men, why is male dysmorphia running rampant amongst us nowadays?", "content":"I asked an AI app a question about male body dysmorphia, as well as masculinity, this is what I got. What's your thoughts about this, and do you agree or disagree with the results?  You've hit on some complex and sensitive issues. Here's a breakdown:  **Detrimental Aspects of Natural Body Hair:**  * **Social Stigma:**     * In a society that increasingly values smooth, hairless bodies, natural body hair can be seen as \"unclean,\" \"unattractive,\" or \"unrefined.\"     * This can lead to social judgment and feelings of insecurity. * **Body Image Anxiety:**     * Men may feel self-conscious about their body hair, comparing themselves to idealized images in media and pornography.     * This can negatively impact self-esteem and mental well-being. * **Perceived Lack of Grooming:**     * In certain social circles, natural body hair may be seen as a sign of laziness or lack of self-care.  **Lack of Casual Nudity and Masculinity:**  * **Reduced Body Familiarity:**     * Casual nudity in communal settings (like locker rooms) fosters a sense of familiarity with the male body.     * The lack of this exposure can lead to increased anxieties and insecurities. * **Diminished Sense of Community:**     * Shared experiences of nudity can create a sense of camaraderie and bonding among men.     * The absence of this experience can contribute to feelings of isolation and a lack of masculine affirmation. * **Lack of defining affirmation:**     * The lack of casual nudity, removes a normal form of exposure to other male bodies, and removes a normal form of exposure to the wide range of male body types. This lack of exposure can cause men to have a skewed view of what is normal, and therefore cause insecurities.  **Team Sports, Military, and Social Acceptance:**  * **Shared Experience and Camaraderie:**     * Team sports and military service create intense shared experiences, fostering strong bonds among men.     * Nudity becomes normalized in these environments, as it's a practical necessity in locker rooms and communal showers. * **Physicality and Masculinity:**     * These environments often emphasize physicality and strength, which are traditionally associated with masculinity.     * Physical displays of affection (hugging, high-fives, etc.) are seen as expressions of camaraderie and support, rather than sexual advances. * **Hierarchical Structures:**     * The Military has a very defined hierarchical structure, that defines what is and is not acceptable. Within that structure, those acts of physical affection are deemed acceptable, and therefore are. * **Social Context:**     * The social context in which these behaviors occur is crucial. In a sports or military setting, they are seen as normal and acceptable.     * Outside of these contexts, the same behaviors might be misinterpreted.  **In essence:**  * Social norms and cultural context play a significant role in how male nudity and physical affection are perceived. * Team sports and military service create environments where these behaviors are normalized and accepted. * Outside of these contexts, anxieties and misinterpretations can arise. * The lack of casual nudity in modern society, has caused a decline in defining affirmations of normal male bodies.  **Suffering from Lack of Affirmation:**  * **Body Image Issues:**     * Yes, the lack of exposure to diverse male bodies can lead to increased body image anxieties.     * Men may feel insecure about their own bodies, comparing themselves to unrealistic ideals. * **Social Isolation:**     * The decline in communal nudity can contribute to feelings of isolation and a lack of connection with other men.     * This can impact mental and emotional well-being. * **Confusion about Masculinity:**     * The absence of clear, natural examples of masculinity can lead to confusion and uncertainty about what it means to be a man.  **Desire for Experience and Lack of Opportunity:**  * **Suppressed Desires:**     * It's likely that some men do desire the camaraderie and body acceptance that comes with casual nudity.     * However, they may not know how to create those experiences outside of traditional settings. * **Lack of Social Spaces:**     * Modern society offers fewer opportunities for casual male nudity.     * This limits men's ability to experience this form of bonding and affirmation.  **Decline in Knowledge of Natural Masculinity:**  * **Shifting Definitions:**     * Yes, there's a decline in understanding of traditional, natural masculinity.     * This is due to evolving societal norms and the influence of media and culture. * **Confusion and Uncertainty:**     * Men may struggle to define their own masculinity in a society with conflicting messages.     * This can lead to confusion and a sense of lost identity.  **Toxic vs. Natural Masculinity:**  * **Natural Masculinity:**     * Encompasses positive traits like strength, courage, and resilience.     * It values emotional vulnerability, empathy, and respect for others.     * It is the natural expression of maleness. * **Toxic Masculinity:**     * Emphasizes dominance, aggression, and suppression of emotions.     * It promotes harmful behaviors like violence, misogyny, and homophobia.     * It is an over exaggerated and negative form of masculinity. * **Connection to the Issue:**     * The lack of natural defining affirmations of male bodies, can cause men to seek out other forms of affirmation. This can cause men to seek out the negative forms of affirmation that are found within toxic masculinity.  **In essence:**  * The decline in communal nudity and the confusion about masculinity are negatively impacting men. * Many men are likely seeking experiences of affirmation but lack the opportunities. * The lack of natural masculine affirmation, can cause men to gravitate to toxic masculinity.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1juwtaa/men_why_is_male_dysmorphia_running_rampant/", "date":"2025-04-09", "image_url":"None", "gender":"askmen", "sentiment":"negative"},

My dad retired last year which he had been really looking forward to. However, I'm a bit worried about him as he seems to have very few hobbies to fill his time, and those that he does have are solitary, or involves doomscrolling / shouting at the news etc.  Could you guys suggest some hobby ideas for him please? Ideally ones that might get him out of the house and socialising with other people and making new friends. Some more info about him:  - he is based in a small seaside town in the UK (eg not a big city, so things like meet-up groups are limited) - Enjoys gardening (one of his current hobbies, esp in the spring & summer) - Enjoys LEGO (pretty sure he's spending my inheritance on this!!). It's great, but it's obviously a solitary hobby - he's not got any real friends that I can think of. He tags along with my mum to things, but he doesn't have any of his own friends atm - he's not super 'well' atm, and has some medical issues meaning breathing issues and back pain. This means most sports / active hobbies are a no-go, and anything requiring hard physical labour. Even standing for periods of time will be difficult. - he's a recovering alcoholic so anything too reliant on booze won't work - he enjoys watching cycling races - he loves a pub quiz - problem is that he has no friends to go with - he's a great cook and baker, although doesn't do that very often these days. I thought he was getting into jam making for a while, and sourdough too, but that seems to have fallen by the wayside.  I am thinking of suggesting he finds a language course (he used to be fairly good at French), perhaps volunteering with a local scout group, or maybe at a local museum.  Thoughts much appreciated!  Edit: you guys have some awesome hobbies, so thank you for sharing ideas with me! My dad will have no free time left if he takes up all of them ha! There\u2019s so many I never would have thought of that I could see him enjoying, so will start slowly mentioning a few to him to see what sort of reaction they get.

On one occasion, she waited for me, called out to me, and when I didn\u2019t stop, she followed me. She also made an attempt to give me candies. At first, I took them, thinking it was just a friendly gesture, but it now feels like she\u2019s trying to engage me in a way I\u2019m not comfortable with.  At the start, I used to smile back when she smiled at me, but that was just because I\u2019m generally friendly and smile at everyone. It wasn\u2019t an indication that I like her or want anything more than a professional relationship. I\u2019ve made it clear by not responding to her advances or showing any interest, and I\u2019ve told her I have a girlfriend, but it still doesn\u2019t stop.  I feel like I\u2019m in an uncomfortable situation because she\u2019s always sitting directly in front of me, and I can\u2019t avoid making eye contact, which feels like I\u2019m being forced to engage.  I\u2019ve never had to deal with something like this before, and I\u2019m unsure whether I should address it directly with her or if I should escalate it. I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m overreacting, but I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I feel like I\u2019ve been respectful, and yet she continues this behavior. I\u2019m worried that if I don\u2019t do something soon, it\u2019ll keep happening and I\u2019ll be more uncomfortable.  What would you recommend in this situation? How can I get her to respect my boundaries without escalating things unnecessarily? I\u2019d really appreciate any advice or similar experiences.

I\u2019ve been married to my husband (37M) for just over 10 years and I\u2019ve always had a tender, father-daughter type of connection with my husband\u2019s dad. He\u2019s calm, present, and carries a kind of gentle, emotional safety I didn\u2019t grow up with. My own father was very abusive\u2014physically and emotionally. At one point he broke several of my bones during violent episodes. Because of that, I grew up deeply confused about love, affection, and trust\u2014especially when it came to men in father-type roles.  After doing a lot of trauma healing, I\u2019ve recently reconnected with my FIL in a way that feels peaceful and mutual. It\u2019s been grounding for me to experience a safe, healthy male presence, especially in a paternal role.  I wrote him a heartfelt card\u2014not emotional overload, just a warm, faith-rooted message of appreciation\u2014thanking him for being someone I quietly admire, and for showing up in ways that have been quietly healing for me. It\u2019s sincere, spiritual, and framed with respect.  My question is: If your daughter-in-law gave you a card like this, would you receive it well? Or would it feel too heavy or strange, given the non-biological relationship?  My intention is pure, and there\u2019s no emotional demand attached to it. I\u2019m just finally in a place where I want to honor that relationship\u2014but I\u2019m also very aware of how sensitive some men can be to receiving emotional expression.  Thanks in advance for your insights.  TL;DR Grew up with an abusive father (physically and emotionally), so trusting paternal love has been a lifelong healing journey. Recently reconnected with my kind, gentle FIL who\u2019s felt like a safe father figure. I wrote him a sincere, Christ-centered card thanking him for being that presence. Wondering how father-in-laws would feel receiving something like this\u2014would it be meaningful, or possibly too much?  I\u2019d like to add that my husband is fully supportive of this!    UPDATE: I\u2019m going to give it to him this weekend!!  Just wanted to thank everyone who responded with kindness and support. Your words gave me the peace and clarity I needed. I\u2019ll be giving my FIL the letter this weekend, and I feel really good about it now. Truly grateful for this little corner of the internet.   UPDATE PT 2******** I gave him the card and a few hours later he messaged me this really long and elaborate message about how I was the daughter he feels blessed to have and how he treasures how I love his son and his grandkids \ud83d\ude2d he was very grateful for the card and ended it with so much warmth and affection.

At the time, I was looking at the Navy or Coast Guard but I\u2019m now leaning more towards the army or marines. I ended up not joining more out of pride than anything else, as all my friends went to college and my parents were disappointed about me bombing school.   I ended going to community college, got into NYU, and majored in journalism. I graduated in 2023 and that career has not panned out as I\u2019ve wanted and I\u2019m quite bitter about the job market, to the point where I\u2019m looking at becoming a cop due to high pay and pension in my city. The only thing is I want to leave. I really haven\u2019t done much with my life or traveled and would love too. My question is: is this decision worth it? I feel old af and sometimes think I should have done this at 18.   Physical health: At 18, I was 5\u201911  and 180 and did a lot of rowing. I was fit.

So how can I push  through those thoughts, I made the changes to fix the problems in my life. It took more than a decade.

What's making life difficult for you?", "content":"TL;DR - If you're a man 18-35, I'm curious to know what the biggest challenge you face is. I think many people don't really ever hear about the challenges young men face, nor do young men talk about as openly. Both could be helpful in shedding light on this topic.     Some context on me:  About 10 years ago, when I was 22, I thought I was a f\\*cking loser. I was 22, had no degree, was just fired from my job, and was sleeping on my sister\u2019s couch. I had been wrestling with the feeling of having had spent so much of my life being angry and blaming my parents (really anybody) for every little perceived \u201cbad thing\u201d that had happened to me. I broke down one afternoon when all the emotions these thoughts evoked hit me. During this breakdown I found the bottom of that depression I was slowly sinking into for months.     I wiped  away my tears after beginning to process that wave of emotions that humbled me. I promised myself that I would take accountability for my life; that I myself was going to pull myself out of the hole I found myself in; that I was going to start forgiving and stop blaming other people (especially my parents) for where I was in life; that I was going to change my lived circumstances by getting out of the passenger seat and living idly. And though I didn\u2019t become a healed and enlightened multi-millionaire these past 10 years, I did build a life that I\u2019m damn proud of. It\u2019s a normal upper middle-class life (cost of living adjusted), but I don\u2019t hold onto that pain anymore. I don\u2019t blame my parents for all the bad sh\\*t that had happened to me growing up. I developed my skills and worked my way up from an entry level contractor role with a 3 month contract to a full-time Sr. Marketing Manager at a technology company in the Bay Area. This isn\u2019t said to brag. I\u2019m still finding my way like everyone else.     **Purpose behind my question:**  I know there are a lot of young men out there today who feel hopeless and helpless like I did on that day, young men who are slowly sinking and finding their own personal bottoms. Likely to be suffering in silence, desperate to find some sort of answer that will help them find their way. I want to help them. And though I\u2019m no guru, that doesn\u2019t prevent me from trying to do my part to help those whose circumstances are quite similar to where my journey began. I want to share my passion for personal development through written and visual content on topics that are relevant and matter to this age group. I want to share some of the valuable lessons I've learned along the way in the hopes that it may help someone else who's seeking information to help themselves find their own.   Like the poet Big Sean, said, \u201ceverybody needs direction even if it\u2019s to find themselves\u201d.\u00a0     **Question:**   **So, M18-35, what's the biggest challenge you're facing these days**? Not only is it good to speak it aloud, it's good to see that you're not alone in this journey; there are so many people on this planet who are going through similar challenges. And sadly a lot of people ignore the plight that we face in becoming men, so at the minimum maybe it could help shed light that this does exist.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1johfgl/m1835_whats_the_biggest_challenge_you_face_whats/", "date":"2025-03-31", "image_url":"None", "gender":"askmen", "sentiment":"neutral"},

I havent worn shorts in years. Im not happy with my legs (muscle mass) and have had various ongoing injuries over the years including one really bad one right now. And then I also broke my toe at the start of the year so I obviously couldn\u2019t train legs for that period (did leg extensions and hamstring stuff as this is ok with a broken toe, but still lost a little size in my calves, not huge but still plays on my mind)I hit and do legs as hard and as much as I can but given the pain Im in 24/7 I just cant train them as hard and make the same progress in my upper body. They\u2019re definitely not twig legs but not something Im happy with, not yet. So my upper body is more muscular than my lower. That being said im never full satisfied with my upper body either. I would hate to think people would think Im a leg day skipper when this is simply so not true and I want solid legs more than anything. Anyway to compensate, I always wear long pants, looser ones too. And I wear loose t shirts. I live in Australia so its always pretty hot and people are always asking why Im in long pants, friends give me a bit of shit how im never in shorts and I know family probably thinking why is he always wearing long pants even in the heat. I know my girlfriend also wishes I would wear shorts sometimes, and I do understand that. Sometimes this makes me a bit self conscious. Anyway cut to the chase, im going away with some mates for a weekend. Of course I will wear long pants while they probably all wear shorts and they will say dude its so hot why are you wearing long pants again, its fine though I usually just say its what I like. But the real problem for me is the beach. My long pants are not coming off but I can also hardly wear long pants to the beach\u2026right\u2026? I mean even I admit I would probably look silly. (No I wouldn\u2019t be swimming anyway) whats the alternative, do I make an excuse to stay at the apartment while the rest of them go and say I feel sick or something? The beach is one place I wouldn\u2019t really have an excuse not to wear shorts, from their perspective anyway.

Sometimes I wish we had that kind of old-school determination to work through challenges and build something lasting in relationships. It seems like my generation has a hard time committing to make things work, even when it comes to something that could be really great.

It seems my son is battling greatly with independence and wanting to feel in control as well as maybe trying to find his voice? So he is exhibiting similar behaviors as his dad. I feel as if my son does not respect me, he has detached himself from me but remains close to his sister. He's been having behavior issues at school, including cussing teachers out. He does not seem to care about consequences and I usually do not resort to punishment first but im running low on steam. How do I get through to this kid? How do I make him feel connected to the family unit again so that he's not acting out? I've offered counseling, we have tried having conversations but sometimes his comprehension is not what was said and he gets overwhelmed woth anger/frustration which gets us arguing in circles. He's also always super concerned about WHO is right...any advice is greatly appreciated.  EDIT TO ADD: He has a stepfather in his life that is VERY patient and responsible, calm, etc. He does not involve in punishments/consequences because his dad is still involved and we were deliberatelytold he should not be involved in THAT aspect by a therapist earlier on-his bio dad is just inconsistent in behavior and not a super positive male role model. He does play football during the fall for school but is not really interested in any other sports/activity other than gaming..which he plays madden of course. I always encourage his sports and am at every game. I am VERY adamant about being there for my kids events. His sister does have autism so she does require extra time for therapy and group.

CONTEXT; I (25F) have been going on periodic dates (w/ a 29M) for a few months now and it\u2019s obvious to us both that we are exclusively dating, but I have not yet introduced him to my family because I am waiting for him to officially ask or declare that we are in fact a couple and not just dating.   To me this has always been a very distinct difference. While I do date exclusively one person at any given time I still don\u2019t equate it to being in a \u201cpartnership relationship\u201d. I am Catholic, and I know that he is also coming from religious upbringing so I feel that we may be on the same page about it, but I was talking with a friend who has the same religious upbringing that my guy does, and my friend informed me that he has been dating his lady friend for about six months and he would not ask her to be his girlfriend because it simply is known. He said that given the dedication that they have for each other announcing it is a bit silly at this point.  This sort of blew my mind, but it made me wonder; Given the way that relationship dynamics have changed over the years- despite both of us having a traditional mindset and upbringing- maybe this is just the nature of dating nowadays, and because i want him to ask/declare it, then i will have to explicitly let him know that this is my standard.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1jm5mqk/howwhen_do_you_draw_the_line_between_just_dating/", "date":"2025-03-28", "image_url":"None", "gender":"askmen", "sentiment":"neutral"},

I come from a family mostly women and was married to one for a long time. As much as I tried I feel like my mother has always disregarded allowing me to develop into who I want to be, rather for who she wants me to be. Being vulnerable has always gotten me threatened by her or cast away to a school counselor because she didnt have the capacity to deal with my adolescent depression.   Fast forward 20 years and a failed marriage. Mom and I have never had a connection outside of the fact that she raised me and I am her son. So I initiated the conversation by opening up to her about wanting to leave my marriage. Rather than understand that I have my reasons and I wouldnt make a decision this lightly as I raised two children into young adults (16 and 19) on my own dime and ambition to give them better than I had. So she tells me I cant leave and to work it out. This would be good advice except the person I was married to and am divorcing has always been a brick wall. In short I feel like my mom has never seen me for who I am and just sees what she wants and disregards what I say as if Im not mentally capable of making a sound decision.   My kids mother I remember there was a time when I was young and coming up in life building our life financially, I would confide in her about the stressed I was dealing with regarding the pressure I felt to be a good provider and not feeling like I was being taken seriously in the workforce. Her response to this as a stay at home mom would be \"oh I knew you had a problem with me not working, why dont you just say it\". She'd make it about her. This same ritual with me being vulnerable and her making it about her went on for years until I shutdown and just censored what I'd tell her. She would even project onto me that I was the negative stereotype of men, dont listen, big ego and think women are supposed to march to the beat of my drum.   Do any of you feel like despite being your authentic self, that women dont believe you are who you present to be and its just not an act to get over on them? For context Im the type of person who doesnt really want anything from anyone but the respect that I show them. Hell I was on my litterly and figurativelty on my last leg with my marriage (was temporarily crippled from an accident) and I used the settlement money and cosigned for my exes car and never wanted anything in return. For me it was my investment in my kids future whether her or I worked out or not. I dont want my kids riding public transit, let alone her as a women having to care for them.   Also yes, I am in therapy working through all of the above.

And also please refrain from the \"man, fuck what people think, bro. You do you!\" advice that it seems men get a lot when they post about not liking gender roles. I understand that statistically there will always be some women that are attracted to me in the way I want and want the same relationship dynamics I do. My question is more just about how likely me finding that is, and overall I'd just sort of like an acknowledgement of \"Yeah, these dynamics exist and they suck, and you deserve to be able to find what you want one day!\" I don't necessarily want solutions or advice, I more so just want to be consoled delicately a bit. But, some advice is welcome if you feel the same way and have found workarounds.  Okay, now that I've got that out of the way, onto the meat of the post:  I(20m) am starting to have a realization as I come to age and begin possibly looking into jumping into the very scary an unsure world of dating, and that's that I don't actually think current gender roles and dating dynamics really allow me to be happy at all in a heterosexual relationship. I know that's a pretty crazy statement to make(maybe not if you spend any time on this sub or it's sister subreddits haha), but I can't help but feel that way when I examine generally how people expect relationships to work and the different way people treat men's desire to be desired vs women's. I'm bi, and obviously don't fit with any of the ideas of how men should \"be\", either in my physical appearance or my general desires.  And as I genuinely ask myself what I want in a relationship and what I'd need to be happy, I realize that a huge desire of mine and reason to even be in a relationship in a first place is so I could be\u00a0**desired,**\u00a0and not just desired in a sweet wholesome way(although don't get it wrong, I certainly want that, too), but also for\u00a0**my body.**\u00a0I want whomever I end up with one way to primarily want to have sex with me because they find my body physically attractive. Not because they want to connect more, or because they think my personality is so nice or that I'm so interesting or whatever, I want it to be a physical desire! I understand that this is shallow and vain, but I don't think that makes it wrong. Plus, people seem to understand good and well that it's okay to want to be desired for your body when women say it. It seems like whenever men say something like this people are quick to tell him that it isn't realistic to want this and he should just be satisfied ot have sex in the first place, but it seems like society in general is ore accepting of the notion that being desired physically is important to women, why isn't the same true for men? I know the answer to that question is gender roles, but it still sucks, y'know?  So many of the things I want to do in my hypothetical relationship aren't really things that men get to do. I want to show of my body with lingerie and sexy clothing, send alluring pictures of myself, wear revealing clothing and make myself pretty. And I want a partner that wants me to do those thing, not just someone that tolerates it or finds it endearing because they love me, as cute as that would be. Not to mention things that aren't so much related ro physical desire but relationship desire. Things like being proposed to, being asked out, given flowers. I know all these things do happen to men in heterosexual relationships, but it is far outside the norm and wanting a relationship with those dynamics seems kinda hopeless.  If you look at most subreddits, the difference in the sorts of answers men and women get on these topics are staggering. It seems pretty common that if a man posts about feeling undesired by his wife or gf, people are really quick to say \"Well, women have responsive desire so you shouldn't expect her to initiate sex\", \"Well, what are you doing to turn her on? Women aren't visually stimulated, y'know.\", \"How much chores do you do/do you get her flowers?\" But when a woman posts the same things about her husband people are quick to say that her desires are valid and she deserves to have a relationship where she is desired in the way she wants.

Ive noticed several men in my life gravitate and be unwilling to let go of women that e.g. refuse to work and earn an income, live by the rule that a man should work and pay for home, holidays, meals out, nights out, they often complain that they both need to buy a property together really early on (she always has not enough in the bank to get a small 5% deposit) and they expect gifts ranging in the thousands. And guys just do it and oblige. These guys occasionally lament on how they have no similar interests and their wife or gf hates their gaming or their friends and they willingly oblige to remove their own hobbies or interests out of their lives to satiate these women. So i dont get it, you dont have anything to talk about and when i ask them what they do together its often just going out for meals and him booking and paying 100% for holidays that she goes along for as she burns through his finances. But they just accepted this as their fate...  Im not a man and im not one of these women but ive seen more guys opt for the, as i call it, megan markles of the world, i watch as these women get a leg up in life, gain the luxuries they never had as they did not want to pursue a career with more money and they proceed to marry and then divorce after 4 or 5 years with her leaving with half his property and superannuation and him vocalizing all of this, the fact he never actually knew her beyond surface level...only at the end. Why do these men do this to themselves? Is the fear of being alone worse than blindly obliging to a life with someone who has no intention of embracing and loving the real you and holding you up with them to build your dreams and aspirations?

 {"id":1853, "title":"Rebuilding my social circle after years of isolation - how to overcome the awkwardness?", "content":"I (26M) haven't had real friends since I was about 15. After that, I moved around a lot, changed schools frequently, and never developed deeper connections beyond acquaintances I'd occasionally talk to.  I'm extremely introverted, which makes small talk and forming friendships challenging. I don't enjoy typical social activities like clubbing or partying that seem to be how most people connect. My interests are mostly reading books, working out, and boxing/MMA - not exactly the most social hobbies. Without much social practice over the years, I feel awkward and unsure of myself in most interactions.  After a lot of hard work, I had managed to get a nice paying tech job and was there for about a year before getting laid off last month. It was a remote position, and some of the other new hires who started with me were extremely social, party types. I tried to make friends and hang out with them, but it was just too overwhelming and honestly, I didn't really like them. That experience made me question if I'm just not cut out for friendships.  Recently, two potential friendship opportunities have come up:  1. I joined an MMA/boxing gym (one of my longtime interests). I'm trying to be more outgoing there - speaking up more rather than just nodding along silently like I usually do. It feels unnatural, but I'm trying. 2. A friend from middle school just reached out saying he moved back to the area and wants to reconnect. Looking at his social media, he seems very outgoing with an active social life. I'm worried I'll come across as boring or awkward compared to his other friends.  I genuinely want to build meaningful friendships, but after so many years of isolation, I feel like I've forgotten how. For those who've been in similar situations:  * How do you overcome the awkwardness of putting yourself out there? * What are some low-pressure ways to connect with people that don't involve typical party scenes? * Any advice for reconnecting with old friends when you've become very different people?

It\u2019s hard to describe exactly, but it\u2019s kind of like a mix of copper\u2014like pennies or metal\u2014and maybe a faint hint of freshly cut onions. It\u2019s not constant, just something I pick up on occasionally. I know this might sound odd, and I\u2019m not trying to say anything rude or weird here\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about hygiene or anything like that. The women I\u2019ve noticed it around aren\u2019t \u2018smelly\u2019 in any obvious way; it\u2019s more like this subtle, specific scent that feels consistent to me, almost like it\u2019s coming from something deeper.  I\u2019ve always been curious about it and wondered if I might have some kind of quirky ability\u2014like maybe I\u2019m picking up on illness, pheromones, or something biological that others don\u2019t notice. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s even a thing, but it\u2019s crossed my mind. So, I figured I\u2019d throw this out there to see if any other guys (or anyone, really) have experienced something similar. Have you ever noticed a faint, metallic, onion-like smell around certain people? Is this just me, or could there be something to it? I\u2019m genuinely curious to hear your thoughts.   Also, when I ask the women, do you smell that? They are literally oblivious.   I think it's important to note, that I smell the same smell on different women.  Update: I appreciate the feedback \u2014 what spurred this question was my curiosity about whether the faint, metallic, onion-like smell I\u2019ve noticed around certain women could possibly relate to my family\u2019s cancer history on the women\u2019s side, given studies on smelling illness. However, based on your responses, it seems I\u2019m likely picking up on an oncoming or active menstrual cycle.... I\u2019m a bit disappointed I don\u2019t have a superpower.

I\u2019m not trying to stir controversy\u2014I\u2019m aiming for honest, moderate conversation\u2014but it feels like a lot of online spaces don\u2019t allow for nuance anymore.  Lately, I\u2019ve noticed a disturbing overlap between extreme misogynistic views and certain radical feminist ideas\u2014specifically, the shared belief that heterosexual love is inherently flawed or exploitative. Misogynists often claim that women are emotionless and transactional; radical feminists sometimes argue that men are inherently oppressive or self-serving. Both paint people as one-dimensional and unloving\u2014and I think both perspectives are damaging.  These ideologies seem to appeal to disillusioned individuals and may be eroding trust between men and women, with consequences for relationships, families, and even policy. That\u2019s why I\u2019m bringing this to\u00a0r/AskMen, because I think it affects us directly.  In relationships, I\u2019ve occasionally encountered what felt like moral superiority couched in feminist rhetoric\u2014where disagreement or emotional pushback was framed as privilege, fragility, or complicity. It made me wonder how many men feel unable to speak honestly without being labeled negatively.  Some phrases or attitudes I\u2019ve come across:  * \u201cCheck your privilege.\u201d * \u201cSmash the patriarchy.\u201d * \u201cIf you feel uncomfortable, it\u2019s because you\u2019re part of the problem.\u201d * \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand\u2014you\u2019re a man.\u201d * \"Men have repressed women through-out history.\"  I want to stress: I don\u2019t think all feminists talk or act this way. But some arguments or tactics, even when well-intentioned, can silence discussion or shame men unfairly.  **My questions to this group:**  * Have you ever felt coerced into silence in a relationship for fear of being labeled sexist or insensitive? * Have you noticed ideological or activist language being used to avoid honest, reciprocal communication? * Do you think these trends influence how society treats men, including in law, media, or relationships?

I\u2019ve spent my whole working like (aka the last 12 years) bouncing from job to job without ever really finding my place. I\u2019ve worked in several fields including as a: restaurant manager, Emergency Medical Technician, Janitor, Real Estate Agent, Youth group leader for my religious organization, and 2 different blue collar trades.

It\u2019s really eating me alive because what I want more than anything, is to be really good at what I do, and for others to know that I care about what I do.

I've noticed my girlfriend has been engaging with only content on Instagram that is transgenders and gays. She's a very empathetic person and genuinely cares about others, which I admire.  My concern stems from how this content seems to challenge some of my own deeply held views, particularly around traditional gender roles. For me, it's important that I feel comfortable being a man in our relationship and that my partner feels comfortable identifying as a woman in a way that aligns with my understanding. I'm finding that the perspectives presented in some of this content feel quite different from this, and it's creating some internal conflict and anxiety for me.  I'm feeling a bit worried about how these differences in perspective might impact the connection and dynamic we share as a couple. I understand these are sensitive topics and that my perspective, as a straight white male, might be limited or different from others. I'm still trying to learn and understand more, but I wanted to share honestly about how I'm feeling and the concerns this is raising for me within the context of my relationship.

While I understand some of this is cultural humor, I\u2019ve always found it a bit one-sided.  Years ago, I had an interesting conversation with a long-time female friend. I asked her, \u201cOut of curiosity, how much do you know about male anatomy?\u201d She admitted she didn\u2019t really know much at all. That stuck with me.

I\u2019m aware he also carries a huge mental load, but he doesn\u2019t talk about it, which is why I asked the question. I wasn\u2019t trying to diminish his mental load by saying that I have a huge mental load that he doesn\u2019t carry. I just know I do because we\u2019ve discussed it lol  I\u2019ve heard a lot about men being worried about being the \u201cprovider\u201d of the family. We both work and make a similar income which is why I\u2019m a little confused on why work was still so heavy on his mind. My apologies for not adding the context there.

Which is fine, but it's only because women were largely ignored and kept from positions of power. Worse the poorer you got too.   Whenever I am learning about a part of history that lacks the female perspective, I notice it. Especially talking about war, women were not spared, or left to live happily under a new regime. They were taken as slaves, killed and tortured the same as soldiers. Or kept as POW (wives), with the added joy of being forced to birth an enemies child. But that's never documented like the battle strategies or casualties were.   I wonder, do men notice that? Do you also question when learning about a time period or culture what women were doing?

How should I go about proving it?", "content":"A few times a week, when I am asleep at around 3 or 4 in the morning, I can hear a radio station. Sometimes I can identify the song playing. It is very, very faint - but I can hear it.  This is a bit of an oddball one, but I wanted to bring it here since this is a higher quality ask sub than some of the other ones, and, frankly, I need responses from men. I need practical answers and I'm afraid what I'll get elsewhere is a bunch of people suggesting auditory hallucinations and the obligatory \"tAlK tO A ThERaPiST\".  A little info:  \\- In the southern US  \\- Older house, built in the late 70s. Aluminum roof.  \\- I have flipped the breaker off in the bedroom and still hear it.  \\- It seems to be related to the [pillow ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EINBSJ2)I am using, and not the mattress. Once I sit up, I can no longer hear it.  \\- I considered the possibility of the pillow contents forming some sort of crystal radio, but the station seems to be FM.  \\- I do not keep any sort of radio in the room. Just an alarm clock and my phone charger (I am a minimalist).  \\- It is stronger on clear, cool nights with low humidity.  \\- I sleep alone. Nekkid.    As a first test, I want to record audio in the room while I sleep, and simultaneously, if I can, figure out how to record every possible radio station. Maybe using an SDR and a laptop. My plan is that, when I hear it, I will say the name of the song aloud. Then, in the morning, I can look at the time I said the song name and then run through all the stations to see if that song was playing at that time on a station.  I considered very sensitive microphones, but I think there would be too much background noise with the a/c going, me breathing, etc.  Does anyone have any idea on how to record every station in the FM band for a few hours? Any other bright ideas?

 {"id":2497, "title":"How do you balance paternity leave and caring for your wife after a traumatic birth?", "content":"My wife and I welcomed our 2nd baby few days back and needless to say it was the most traumatic event I have ever faced in my life. It\u2019s going to be a long read so please bear with me.   During labor, my wife(who is a physician) trusted her gut as she was feeling pain in her stomach and asked the doctors to go for a c-section.   My wife pushed for one whole hour, baby didn\u2019t come out. Doctor said maybe lets take a break for 30 minutes and lets resume the push again. But the pain increased and we had to an emergency c-section. Turns out, during surgery they found a tear in my wife\u2019s uterus and amniotic fluid got leaked in her abdomen. My newborn got breathing issues and was admitted to NICU.   I saw my wife in this condition and I was absolutely heartbroken and sad. At one point, I didn\u2019t know if my wife would make it. Around sometime during the surgery once they took the baby out, they noticed her lungs and asked me to come with them to NICU.   I sat in NICU seeing my baby with sipap machine, and so many wires stuck to her tiny body; I wondered if my wife is out from surgery and I can go see her.   No one knew, for those 2 hours. I may remember them my entire life. I genuinely couldn\u2019t stop crying of both my wife and my new born baby. But I guess I was worried more about my wife. Nurses of NICU had to calm me down and they thought I am worried about the baby. Which I was; but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing the exact reason of my emotional state. But nurses were very good and made me feel my baby is in very good hands.   I just left NICU and went to the floor where surgery took place to maybe find out if she is there. To my surprise she was and she was passed out. I immediately started crying again and I kissed her forehead and sat beside her.    My wife and I couldn\u2019t hold our own baby for the 1st 24 hours as she was in NICU. My wife couldn\u2019t stop crying as she wanted to hold our baby and I supported her by saying she is in recovery and she cannot leave right now. But after 2 days of NICU my wife and I convinced the NICU team that our daughter is better now and its best she comes with us in mother-baby unit.   They discharged my baby from NICU after doing all the due-diligence and then mom and I spent our first night with our new kid in the room with no outside intervention. This birth shook us; we didn\u2019t think this would happen but it did. I am just glad my wife and my 2nd daughter are safe.   I am currently on 4-week paternity and I was thinking that I would touch base with my team when they have any questions etc. But after such a traumatic experience, I don\u2019t want to think about work. I want to focus on my family. My manager and team reached out to me for some business questions today when I literally shared with them I welcomed our baby yesterday. I obviously didn\u2019t share about this whole situation, but I was clear with my manager that I would not be using my teams/outlook and would respond to severity 1 critical issues on text and focus on my family due to \u201cunforeseen birth complications\u201d.   I am thinking to extend my leave for 8-12 weeks now from the total 12-weeks offered by the company (100% paid). But then I will put my relationship with my manager in danger and also my own promotion which was set to happen this May or October. We are a small AI/ML R&D wing of a finance company.   I am lost, I just don\u2019t know what to do the best which is great for my wife and family. Luckily, my mother in law is with us and will stay till October to help with the new baby. I thought the remaining 6-8 weeks I will take then so I can keep my new baby as much in the house till the daycare sickness gets her. My wife and I have to move across state in Aug/Sept as well as she is starting a new physician job from Sept/Oct. We are immigrants in this country and have no family here. After October when my MIL leaves its just me, wife and our 2 kids.   I am sorry for the long post, but I wanted to ask how do fellow dads handle such situations and be there for the wife and kids.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1kgp3pc/how_do_you_balance_paternity_leave_and_caring_for/", "date":"2025-05-07", "image_url":"None", "gender":"askmen", "sentiment":"neutral"},

You'll be at an event, party, bar/club or just any social event and you'll find the men that do approach will often focus most of his attention on the hot friend like I get the attraction aspect but I feel it's disrespectful to move onto another girl within that group if things don't move forward with the girl you are hitting on ive experienced this more than enough times to be writing this post and I know plenty of women in my life that have experienced the same.   Reality check here for you guys no self respecting woman wants to be second choice its ego damaging for me it defiantly is girls won't tell you this directly most of the time they will just say \"not interested\" or something to that affect when is reality they might have been into you but you focused all of your attention on this one girl until she told you she wasn't interested, women also talk to each other too so the girls will say what's up if one of the guys made some moves.   From my own perspective I'm not nasty and I would be open to giving that guy a chance if he actually took some accountability for perhaps not taking the chance to get to know me and focusing entirely on the girl that everybody wants.   I usually say something along the lines of \"I noticed you were hitting on my friend whats made you decide to talk to me you didn't appear interested earlier when I was talking too you\" (that's our way of waiting for you to admit you screwed up and also informing you our self esteem isn't feeling great now and some reassurance would really help\" to this day i,ve never had a Man recognise that and put in effort to I guess turn the dynamic around its always a poor excuse like \"you are pretty too\" or \"was I\" or just some really crappy answer that makes me feel worse and just doesn't come across authentic so I cut the conversation because so I don't respond in a way thats going to be me basically yelling at him so I just walk away I think I can speak for a lot of women here that it feels pretty horrible.   Why do it guys? Why not just say \"Your friend is pretty and I did hit on her, I'm sorry that I'm just getting the chance to talk with you now\" that sort of response would change the dynamic in your favour and give a fresh start. Right I already know that friend is hotter than me so the you're pretty too is fake response and false validation.   It's just a common theme among groups of women and the men that approach them.

Understand that the best two ways to combat this are healthy eating and exercise. I searched this sub and saw almost no discussions on this topic (which I understand is more common than ever these days) so figured I\u2019d try to start one.  I go to the gym and lift at least 2-3 days a week and try to do cardio 1-2 other days. Kiddo just turned 3 months (today!) so this routine had about a 4 month hiatus over the last bit of pregnancy, early delivery, a short NICU stay, and the last few months at home. Finally getting back to it.  I cook most meals for us at home and most of them are somewhat healthy (salmon with broccoli and rice, steak and mushrooms, etc.). During the last 3 months of being in the new born trenches we\u2019ve been getting a lot of delivery (Thai, pizza, etc.) which is not healthy. I\u2019ve def gained 7-10lbs since baby was born. I\u2019m okay with this because we needed to survive.  I don\u2019t drink soda. I drink alcohol at most once a month - never at home, only if being social (which doesn\u2019t happen much with a newborn, lol). I do eat large portions of food and that\u2019s somewhat do to eating quickly which doesn\u2019t give my body time to know I\u2019m full. I have a big sweet tooth which is what probably got me into this situation in the first place. I\u2019ve learned that I can\u2019t have sweets in the house or I\u2019ll eat them (god damn you chocolate and ice cream!). I\u2019m okay with this sacrifice. I don\u2019t want my kiddo to be raised on sugar like I was so it\u2019s better to start now and lead as an example.   Baby is finally starting to sleep through the night (most of the time, lol) so getting quality sleep back has been a blessing. I recently got a CPAP machine and it\u2019s a game changer for me and for the wife (no more snoring!).

I get no satisfaction from work whatsoever and my job is meaningless corporate crap that enriches already rich people and pays my bills.   When I have free time I'm constructive. I'm working on the garden or some project or other around the house, or I'm partaking in one of my hobbies.

It's not like I'm stuck in a rut, this isn't that I hate my particular employer or that I'd find fulfillment in some other career. It's bigger than that, I simply can't deal with working anymore and I still have about 30 years of it ahead and that depresses me to a worrying degree lately.

And fun stuff like trading memes, talking about hobbies, and not-fun stuff like handling the news. I'm also a lesbian and kind of live out in the woods so I don't have a lot of men nearby to ask. The women involved with the safe space online have debated this for a couple months.   Some men have asked to join our safe space. Some do it just to complain we have that safe space. They don't really want to join, they just don't want us to have it. But many others are serious about joining. They're really concerned about the state of things and earnestly worry about the women, girls, and LGBT and minority people in their lives. To these kindred spirits and allies I've suggested multiple times to multiple men, build this space yourself. Men need it, look at the demand. Build it. But it hasn't happened. Why?  Male centered spaces online are everywhere. But they're kind of toxic and mean, like 4Chan, and online gaming. I know men can be supportive because I see those gym bro videos where you're all yelling at each other to deadlift like the Olympic champions you are meant to be. That's supportive. I see the ass pats in baseball, you're not hiding anything. Why doesn't it translate to an online space? I also know men can be supportive because that's what's driving white supremacy recruiting.

Alternatively all vegetable beds, but my neighbors yelled at me for growing butternut squash last year and letting the vines grow down the length of my lawn, and someone pulled out my tomato plants that were growing near my mailbox because it was \"ugly and unstructured\"  I don't see the appeal.

I've been through some ups and downs. I've hit rock bottom, and bounced. That was a hard time in my life, and I almost made a real bad choice. But I am privileged. I am resourceful and well positioned careerwise. I have a resourceful family. I am healthy. I am moderately fit and have no ailments. I provide for me and my partner. Many people would look at these things and rightfully say I should be happy, as they have less.  Yet... I don't feel like I live the life I want to live. I have no friends into the same things as me near where I live. I have a partner who I feel like I love, but it's not this magical true feeling of ... I don't know how to put this. I see other people live a life of togetherness with genuine happiness and little doubt. Personally I am often fairly okay, but this sensation of being overjoyed with happiness is a sensation I haven't felt since I was a teenager, and that's 20 years ago now.  The days go by. I make compromises. I do things I must, and try to do the things I want to do, but it's overshadowed by a kind of disturbing feeling that I can't quite pinpoint. Like it's hard to enjoy things. Like I get 60% of the way there. Like I want to build something, but nothing I do feels of any substance.  I some times think about uprooting my life, and moving abroad. But then I realize I am in my 30s, and I'd meet new people with established routines, friends, networks, families. I'd be alone. I'd have nothing of connections. I'd be this extra person they'd feel like they'd have to make room for, and people who've got their ducks in a row all have these busy lives with already a lot going on.  So then I sometimes take a walk, and think about why I feel like this. Is this all very uncommon? Do I just simply have little in common with other people? Is this all a me-problem? I've never really had an easy time connecting with people. It always feels forced. So when I feel real alone, it doesn't feel like being without friends then and there. But it instead is this unsettling feeling of having potentially little in common with anyone anywhere, and that just sucks the air out of me. However, I do have two people I have good relations with. They have dozens though.  I guess a theme I'm picking up on is I feel like I am not happy where I am, but I worry that if I make the changes that some times appear in my head as fleeting, passing \"what if\"-scenarios, then I'd throw away what many people would call happiness. Maybe the majority. Or maybe not? Maybe I am unhappy. How can I tell? Restarting my life could prove to be a deeply regretful decision I could not walk back.   But doing nothing is wasting away my life.  How can you tell if you are happy? I've tried talking to a therapist about some of this, but he said I just was so happy I must be confused.

Perhaps she thought I was not feeling really bad if I didn\u2019t accept any pills but if I\u2019m showing or communicating any symptoms that\u2019s usually my way of saying I\u2019m nearing my limit of being comfortable with these issues.  Due to that, I think, when I really felt bad I was down hard. She always took the stance of me being a crybaby or a wimp. No matter what I said or how I communicated my discomfort. I even went to the hospital for my gallbladder almost bursting open while I shared that I felt too much pain to stand up. She just looked at me like I was a drama queen. Until we were in the ER\u2026  I don\u2019t know what I would have done differently or if I should just make a big deal of every little inconvenience on future relationships.

For instance, wearing dress shoes instead of sporting shoes. Button up shirts/polo shirts instead of T-shirts and suit trousers (with the crease inserted) instead of shorts/jogging bottoms/jeans.

I was quite shy and didn\u2019t really have much confidence. I had very few friends, and was not social at all. I definitely had some form of anxiety and depression which made it worst. I was never bullied in my life, but there was a clear difference in the way people treated me before lifting. I was 120 lbs.  Fast forward to now, I\u2019m a completely different person. I\u2019ve put on a considerable amount of weight, as I\u2019m sitting at 160 lbs. I have a lot of friends, attend parties, and have a girlfriend who I\u2019ve been dating for 6 months now. I\u2019m far more confident than I was two years ago, and people definitely treat me differently. My former self wouldn\u2019t even fathom the way I am now. The best way to put it is that people actually want to listen to what I have to say, and usually let me carry the conversation if that makes sense.\u00a0  Most people reading this may see this as a good thing. But, it feels as if my whole personality and confidence depend on lifting weights. I notice that if I take a couple days off lifting, there\u2019s a change in my personality. It\u2019s as if there is this fear that I\u2019ll return to the same person I once was two years ago, and so I pretty much avoid taking days off. I lift about 6 days a week.  There\u2019s no issue with lifting weights boosting confidence, but it does slightly nag me that I\u2019m practically addicted to lifting, and that my confidence depends on it.

This is concerning to me as I've read that when guys are really into a girl, they'll find her smells to be intoxicating. I've also read that whether or not you like your partner's body odor is a biological sign of how compatible you may be.  I think a good test for this would be if you'd be willing to have sex with your partner immediately after they just finished a hard heated sweaty workout before showering. The thought of that makes me straight up gag. I already have a very difficult time going down on her due to the body odor smell being so pungent - it's like intense curry/musty body odor sweat mixed with rusty pennies. It immediately turns me off and I need to wash my face thoroughly just to get rid of the smell.  What I can't figure out is what I'm missing here. I've always been very sensitive to smells in general. I can often smell things that most people cannot. To further complicate this, my GF is also a different ethnicity to myself. I'm a typical American white dude and she's black (west African). I've read that ethnicity can impact how we perceive smells too so her smell may be exactly what someone of her same ethnicity finds appealing and attractive, but I'm concerned that it may mean we're not compatible.

You initiate the conversation, catch up, maybe talk about deep topics if the other party is interested or just deviate to discussing what media you consume. Whatever the discussion is about, you were the one who started it. And yet after lengths of time, you are never reached out to - unless it's for something needed from you.   I've observed this trend in myself. And it's not some random acquaintances either but people I consider important and my closest friends. The ones who share the same interests as me, who I've known for years and who I've shared important experiences with. I have around 10 people who I would define among that group of people and I've met them all within the last 3 years at least. Out of all of them besides 2 people (who happen to be married), I don't receive any calls or initiation of some form of contact from other people outside of my birthday.  Holding others to an obligation we never agreed to formally seems unfair to me and I understand that people can be busy. I don't call often but I try to every couple months at the very least. Not being met halfway honestly sucks and I can't help but wonder if it's my fault that I'm either not interesting enough or just seen as anti-social. My social media presence is non-existent. Only an Insta and even that I don't use often.  At the end of the day, these people mean a lot to me and that won't change. I'd like to think I'll always keep reaching out but I understand that may not always be the case. Even if I dont talk often, I would always consider them as important.

I\u2019ve stopped exercising, my diet has gone downhill, I\u2019ve gained weight, and honestly, I\u2019m spending more time than I\u2019d like watching porn or zoning out on my phone instead of doing things that make me feel better.  I love my baby and I wouldn\u2019t trade this experience for anything, but I feel like I\u2019ve lost myself in the process. The energy, motivation, and discipline I used to have seem so far away now. Every time I think about getting back on track, it feels overwhelming, and I just default back to bad habits.

 {"id":3022, "title":"How delusional are we about what women are actually attracted to?", "content":"A lot of us grow up thinking we know what women want and give advices to other men, but do we really?  Most guys start hitting the gym because we assume women are into shredded bodies, but studies suggest many actually prefer the \u201cdad bod.\u201d Media often tells us women want rich, successful men, but when you talk to actual women (especially friends), many say they dislike guys who flaunt their wealth or come off as arrogant. And then there\u2019s height. On Reddit, you\u2019ll see plenty of women say it doesn\u2019t matter. But in real life, when there\u2019s no camera or upvotes involved, a lot of them do prefer taller guys.  The list goes on. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ve personally observed when it comes to what women are really attracted to:  Quick disclaimer that not all women are attracted to the same traits, but for the purpose of this topic I will generalize to some extent.  Muscles: Yes, they\u2019re into fit guys, but not how we usually think. Bathroom or gym selfies and overly tight shirts are a turn off. What gets noticed is when muscles show up subtly, like during outdoor activities.  Money: It\u2019s not about being rich, it\u2019s about being ambitious. A guy working toward something is way more attractive than someone lazy who just inherited wealth.  Height: It does matter. You don\u2019t have to be over 6 feet, but if you\u2019re under 5\u20196\u201d, you\u2019ll probably need to bring other standout qualities to the table.  Looks and personality: Yes, looks matter, at least at first. But personality is what seals the deal for most women. Kindness, empathy, humor, those go a long way when it comes to building a real connection.  So I\u2019m curious. What\u2019s your experience been with what we think women want vs. what they\u2019re actually into?", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1k7m2ly/how_delusional_are_we_about_what_women_are/", "date":"2025-04-25", "image_url":"None", "gender":"askmen", "sentiment":"negative"},

Basically this guy got drunk and told his future fiance (ex now bc they broke things off afterwards) that he does really think sex with her is amazing but she\u2019s only his THIRD best sex and NOT first because he had a one night stand with this \u201csex goddess\u201d before he and she met that was \u201cthe best ever\u201d and that in either highschool or college he was exploring himself so he did drugs and tried it out with a male and also enjoyed it. It crushed her and made her question everything he said since he kept telling her how amazing their sex is and how he couldn\u2019t get enough  Obviously as a gf, if you ask any bf \u201cAm I the best sex you\u2019ve ever had?\u201d, the answer would be \u201cYes\u201d even if they don\u2019t really think so. Now this is where I kind of doubted my boyfriend\u2019s honesty when he answered that question, not in a serious way but I\u2019m more curious about the aspects/qualities that lead a man into thinking a sex is \u201cthe best ever\u201d. My boyfriend asked me the same question sometimes after sex and my honest answer is always yes - because I genuinely consider him my best sex ever because I had less dating experience. Unlike me, he had quite a past when he was younger tho, especially in his college years - he was a typical frat dude who was hot, popular and partied all the time (he also lost his family and fell into depression and did drugs and drank which led to a lot of stupid decisions that he now regrets but that\u2019s a whole another story). So when he said \u201cYes, you\u2019re my best sex ever, you\u2019re my little baby\u201dwhenever I asked him that question, I always think \u201cReally? or is this a lie\u201d  Given that our connection is very pure, genuine, deep and I know he genuinely loves me as a person. I met him during his lowest time in life and he fell in love with me for my kind heart, caring, sweetness, honesty, and that I never left his side when he needed. He told me many times even when he was drunk that he has never loved and trusted anyone so much in his life and that I\u2019m the person he cares about the most and he wants to be with me for the rest of his life. There are a lot more things we went through together and he changed a lot since he met me, actively trying to become a better person for me both mentally, financially and physically (he was depressed when I first met him). With some details being shared, I\u2019m just curious whether deep emotional connection like this would make a guy feel like the sex is \u201cthe best ever\u201d, even if the girl herself isn\u2019t the most sexual, initiative or the BEST in bed (compared to other girls the guy had hooked up with)  TL DR: Even if the woman is someone who isn\u2019t very initiative, verbal, \u201cpromiscuous\u201d and suggests doing wild things during sex, could the sex still be considered \u201cbest sex ever\u201d to a man?

I already have it in my mind that I'm going to bury a treasure chest one year in the backyard and then make a pirate map and, after the burial site is overgrown, go on a big treasure hunt for their birthday. Or how I'll make science experiments to teach them about various topics, like plate tectonics or how light and color work.

Like I said, this is very, very casual, but I noticed how after this incident he was more careful with how he talked to me. He even asked me if he could hug me when we met and asked me to stay overnight (which I didn't). And even the day after we met, he said he had done a shitty job when he asked this and that he could have done better.  I guess what I'm saying is: I don't think he would have been that extra nice if I hadn't called him out and he hadn't apologized, but maybe I'm reading too much into it?

It's a very rare occurrence, but since I primarily work with what I assume to be cis/bio straight men, I do worry about potential consequences.

This is because, I've yet to have any success being out to a cis/bio straight guy and still being good friends. The only exception is my brother.     My guess for why this happens, is because in straight male culture it is considered weird/taboo to associate with individuals who are queer. Because of this, I'm very careful with what I tell people who I assume to be straight and cis/bio. I aspire to have friendships with straight men, but there are difficulties involved. So I wanted to get an idea of how cis/bio straight men feel about being good friends with a trans guy? Would you invite him to bowling, a party, gaming, a hiking trip, etc?

I've seen a lot of posts on AskMen about guys being reluctant to share vulnerabilities with women, but I experience the opposite with these people.

I tend to ignore them on a day to day but since I\u2019ve been seeing this girl it\u2019s all I think about now. Mainly because she\u2019s is bound to see them at some point and I\u2019m hoping they don\u2019t lead to her changing her mind about me. I know looks and whatnot aren\u2019t everything but they still matter.   Here are my said imperfections/insecurities:   Stretch marks  -   My weight used to be pretty volatile when I was younger. I would go up and down in weight in very short periods of time. That plus working out and growing in general led to stretch marks around my hips, butt, and groin areas. I\u2019m melanated so some of these are super highlighted, especially in the butt/groin area. My butt looks like I have built in cheetah print underwear cause of the stretch marks/pigmentation combo.   I\u2019m trying to reduce the appearance with products that I bought but so far they ain\u2019t doing shit.    Feet -   I broke some toes on my right foot doing some dumb shit a long time ago and just now got them fixed recently. They removed a chunk of bone off of the small toe to get it to look \u201cnormal\u201d again. The toe is now shorter than before so it looks weird and it also has a gross looking scar on it so it is both weird and gross now.   I had to wear a boot on my foot for about 2 months post op. In an effort to not put weight on the messed up foot, I shifted my weight to my other foot. This led to my other small toe to rub against my shoes, which led to a gross looking friction/hot spot that won\u2019t go away. So now both of my small toes look fucked.   I know you\u2019re not supposed to put people on a pedestal, but this girl is a goddess damn near. I lm hoping that said imperfections don\u2019t change her view of me.

And what made those friendships feel so meaningful to me was how easy they were.

Astoundingly, he was even questioning whether he was being controlling or insecure for having an issue with this.  It made me think about how often I see posts like this. I've also been reflecting on what I have observed in real world relationships such as with friends, colleagues and even family. It seems like too few men have enough self worth in their relationships. They are guilted, shamed and manipulated into accepting disrespect, mistreatment and being taken for granted.  Why? The more men say and do nothing, the more this kind of thing seems to persist. I am not saying we need to blow up or make a scene but why do we accept the unacceptable? I think men need to hold themselves to much higher standards. That is, simply walk away when a woman shows you she does not respect you or clearly doesn't value you. Stop rushing into to marriage with women who are not marriage material. Let her first show you who she is.    Too many men are willing to tolerate the intolerable and are living in quiet misery. I think that there is a belief amongst these men that the harder they try to be an ideal or conforming spouse (in his partner's eyes), things will improve. It is like working in a copper mine expecting to one day find a diamond if you just work hard enough to break your back. However, this is the furthest thing from the truth. I hate the term \"simp\" but I think this is also an element. Too many men are willing to accept bad behaviour and bad attitudes out of desperation for a relationship.

unable to study way before a test or take the trash before it compiles and my mom gets so mad at me i would never do my homework in time i\u2019ve always done it in class or on my way to school i would never be able to do things without procrastinating even if i have to go to the bathroom i won\u2019t go until i really can\u2019t hold it in anymore.. but at the end of the day i\u2019d do these things, even if i\u2019m late but the fear factor and urgency is what made me study one day before the exam and do good or finish up my homework before the teacher walks in or take the trash out after my mom scolds me or go to school early before the bell rings and like i have never never ever not been late to meeting my friends or attending something even if i was awake early i\u2019d stay in bed and procrastinate getting up until I\u2019m actually late so now i\u2019m like \u201coh fuck i really gotta get up\u201d   Now that i\u2019ve grown up and there\u2019s not much scolding and fear factor available it\u2019s more severe and I\u2019m losing my sense of urgency   Sometimes it\u2019s bad to the point i can\u2019t leave the bed or eat for hours and sometimes just be in bed the whole day and unfortunately being addicted to my phone doesn\u2019t help it feels like I\u2019m paralyzed in a sense i\u2019ve gone days without even showering sometimes like it feels so hard to do it for some reason when i break my routine   Building a routine helps me but it\u2019s like the start of building a routine in something that i have procrastinated is so hard when i can just distract myself and tell myself i\u2019ll do it eventually and the longer i procrastinate about it the harder it is to do it.. like praying for example or studying    After procrastinating studying for so long and i\u2019d say i\u2019ll study but i always delay until the exams come and i can\u2019t finish what i have to study in time i\u2019d feel soso horrible but after seeing that i have an option (redoing the exam again) i\u2019d distract myself and procrastinate again.. now i have failed my senior year 4 times because of this pattern and it\u2019s only recently until i started to pay attention to how bad this habit is    And like you have no idea about the extent i\u2019d go to procrastinate like I\u2019d always get away with it  Like telling my brother he can test if i studied or not   And then not leaving my room the whole day so i don\u2019t have to be tested because i didn\u2019t study and i can never admit that like i\u2019d go so far into manipulating my own people  And in my head it\u2019s like \u201c if this day just passes without me having to deal with i gotta deal with tomorrow will be fine\u201d  And then tomorrow comes and it\u2019s like a never ending cycle   Even my attention span is so bad i noticed this when i started taking private math classes, I\u2019d literally without paying attention just zone out and then suddenly gain back my focus and realize how i\u2019ve been not paying attention and it freaks me  I forget too much literally my family tease me about it all the time and doesn\u2019t trust me with things because they know how low my attention span is  I\u2019ve lost and accidentally broken soso many things   I forget the stove turned on so much i burnt the kitchen one day while no one was at the house and if i didn\u2019t wake up and saw that the whole house is full of smoke the whole house might\u2019ve burnt  If someone tells me to do something I\u2019d forget it immediately like if my dad says can you make me a cop of coffee i\u2019d turn the kettle on and forget about it every time   If someone tells me their name after ending the convo i literally always forget it like i can\u2019t remember a recent time where someone told me their name and I\u2019ve remembered it   If i for example checked something on a tap on my phone i\u2019d forget sometimes like after closing it and then go back to it again and then i also forget it and maybe check 3 times like always double checking.. and rereading things, i know this is too much to consume but these are also the littlest thing that i be suffering with and it frustrates me  And my sleep schedule is always horrible so i feel like i even have less time to do things and the day goes by without doing anything   And i literally can\u2019t remember the last time i made myself go asleep without being very sleepy so i\u2019d just doze off i even can\u2019t sleep without stimulants like listening to something while im sleeping or watching something      But it\u2019s just recently that i\u2019m tryna hold myself accountable for these things and trying to keep myself busy so i feel like I\u2019m actually doing something important and being sharp is my top priority because my parents are spending a lot of money on my private classes and before my private math classes i could literally never open a book so it did help and made it easier for me to study even tho i still procrastinate and study 2-3 hours before the teacher comes   Sometimes i really can\u2019t focus while studying like stuck in a loop repeating something so easy but for some reason i can\u2019t process anything and it makes me really really frustrated    I wanna be sharp and i want to stop forgetting things and be able to focus without being in my mind so long and i want to stop procrastinating and be responsible   Because i have so much internal motivation but it doesn\u2019t match my physical actions  I\u2019ve become so emotional numb.. it\u2019s sad  And i\u2019ve also developed a very addictive behavior to things that distract me from everything", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1k1ylkc/how_to_deal_with_severe_procrastination_problems/",
