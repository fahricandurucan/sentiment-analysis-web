At the same time, I have a slight scarcity mindset and worry about having enough into old age.  \\- Have coped well under pretty much non-stop stress since my mid-20s (including earning a master's degree while working full-time with young kids, motherhood, marriage, loss and grief, and, now aging parents and young adult children)  \\- Have no idea how long I might live (no one does!).

 {"id":44, "title":"Seeking GenX hive mind on CD collection...", "content":"Greetings fellow Xers! Here's a very low-drama dilemma for your consideration.  Over the years I managed to acquire what I'd characterize as a sizable collection of music CDs. Let's call it \\~400 or so. Up until about a decade ago, I had a home stereo system, including a CD changer (a thousand years ago I had the big 100 disc carousel--remember those??--more recently just a 6-disc player). In any case, I've since gone digital. Over that decade, we've moved three times and shifted the boxed/unopened collection from one storage area to another in our homes. They are currently high on a shelf in our garage. Music is a big part of my daily routine, now mostly via Apple Music and numerous streams.  The impending, mid-August departure of our youngest for school along with recent experiences helping friends attend to older family members' estates/worldly belongings has me thinking about my CDs and what on earth to do with them. Here are some of my musings:  1) Other than in our aging cars, I have no means to play the CDs at this time. Do new/more recent cars even have CD players?  2) We're pretty much all-in re the Apple ecosystem. Barring externalities, I doubt that will change anytime soon.   3) I don't foresee acquiring gear to play CDs in the future.  4) I doubt they have any monetary value and that's fine. My disposal plan is to ask an acquaintance who owns a record shop (yes, really, they still exist) if she wants them. If no, then Goodwill (a solution I don't love, but there it is).  5) I will sort through them before they go and add to my digital library. Not by ripping them (remember doing that???), rather simply by using the \"add\" function in Apple Music. Only plan to download particularly resonant those albums/tracks.  I acknowledge this is very much a \"first-world\" problem. I welcome your thoughts and invite solutions I've perhaps not considered.

I know that teenagers have sex, you\u2019re a moron if you think they don\u2019t. I just want my boys, and girl to be as safe as possible when the time comes. My oldest is 15, but he doesn\u2019t drive. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s time that I start having condoms available, no questions. But I have been married for 20 years and haven\u2019t bought or used condoms in an equal amount of time. The question is, is it time to make them available and what should I get, not up on the current condom product development or tech.  ***Update\u2014 Got him a box of Durex that expires in 2029. The shocked look on his face was priceless. He started stammering and was like, we aren\u2019t, I promise. To which my response was, I just want you to have all the tools at your disposal to make responsible choices when the time comes and it may not come.  I don\u2019t want you to be a Dad at 16. Just make good choices and the best choices for you and her at this point.

Husband spent his 20s and early 30s in the arts and then had 2 layoffs from companies in his 30s. He\u2019s only saved about $20k. I\u2019ve been working nonstop since 16 but worked in education and then nonprofit, very underemployed for many years. I have around $75k saved (it was much higher 2 months ago\u2026)   I\u2019m 39 and my husband is 41. We have one child and daycare, summer camp, and student loans (mine), plus Covid leading to both of being laid off in our mid 30s really derailed us more than we anticipated. I posted recently in r/MiddleClassFinance and had no idea how many people in their 30s had over $500k saved already. Even my most irresponsible best friend casually dropped the other day that she had lost $80k in her retirement account last Friday - which is how I found out she had $275k saved.  I know we\u2019re lucky that we have what we have, and I guess I spent so much time with that perspective that I didn\u2019t let the numbers get to me. Now I\u2019m realizing I\u2019m maybe 25-30 years from retirement and that the stock market might not be quite as bullish as it was in my 30s.   I took some cash out our vacation fund this week (we haven\u2019t been on a vacation in 5 years, but still, this is important) and bought 5 shares of VT in an investment account when it was seriously dipping which I feel like is a start. We\u2019re both going to try to max out our 401ks and I\u2019m trying to figure out how to open a Roth IRA - I probably missed the boat on 2024.  We finally have an OK emergency fund, no debt other than 2 car payments, and as I mentioned no mortgage. So these are all huge positives. We also make solidly middle class salaries and live somewhere with a good mix of retirees, families and young people so we could theoretically stay here for ever if we can afford the taxes.

 {"id":146, "title":"Ever had to rebuild your whole life from square one?", "content":"*Once again I turn to my beloved GenXers, the most compassionate, intelligent and resilient group of people that I know. Not for advice, but just to share my burdens a bit. And once again, I apologise for the rant and the long post.*  So, some time ago, my wife decided to break up with me. 12 years and a family with our beloved child gone. Just like that. We drifted apart she said. Maybe we did and maybe I am very much at fault here for not being more \u201cexciting\u201d in our relationship. I am not playing the victim here. People break up; it happens.   What really kills me though, is that I am now being forced to rebuild my life from scratch. And I don\u2019t want to. At 48 years of age I never thought I would have to do this. And it sucks beyond words.   You see, when my wife decided to end things we had just immigrated back to her own country in the Nordics, mostly for the benefit of our son\u2019s education/life prospects and for my wife who was unhappy living in my country (Mediterranean) for a long time now. I didn\u2019t have a job lined up there yet, but we figured I\u2019d do my best to learn the language, to brush up my skills and get a better job. Maybe go back to college even. Turns out I never had the chance; within a few months it was all over. She got disillusioned with me and decided that she saw me more as a roommate than a lover.    However, breaking up left me in an impossible situation: I had no job prospects, no grasp of the language, no income, no friends or family, not even a place to stay of my own. To make things worse, we had to settle in the tiny village town where my wife grew up, where there are almost no foreigners, noone speaks english (they will literally avoid even coming close in an effort not to have to speak english) and jobs are non-existent even for locals. As such, I had no other option but to go back to my country, at least for now.  So here I am, alone, broken and broke. Since salaries are rather low and rents have gone through the roof, my only option for now is to try and get my old job back and move to a small summer cottage that I own and work from there (it\u2019s a remote position). I need to save up as much money as possible if I'm ever to try and go back.  But I am scared shitless.    I am afraid I\u2019ll end up wasting away in a tiny house out in the sticks alone.    I am afraid of the crushing loneliness being there by myself.   I am afraid of even settling into that little house because I feel that I will lose the drive to find a way back to my precious boy who means the world to me.    I am afraid that my child will end up hating me for going away and that I will become irrelevant as a parent.  My child is coming over for the summer holidays in 2 months and I am so ashamed that I have nothing here for him. I am temporarily staying at my old family home which after the summer will be rented out and I have nothing to my name anymore. Sure, I will take him to that little cottage but how can I even begin to compare with all the trappings (house, car etc) that my wife has gotten up there? I am so ashamed and I feel like such a loser\u2026  And to make things worse I miss everything. I miss my family, I miss our life before it all went to shit, I miss my wife who was my partner, friend and lover and most of all I miss my child and he misses me back too\u2026 What kind of parent can I be from the other side of the damn continent?   Logic dictates that I need to rebuild my life. But I just don\u2019t want that. I just want to make things all right. I don\u2019t want a \u201cnew\u201d relationship, I don\u2019t want to meet people, I don\u2019t want to mingle or do all the crap that singles do. Not when I\u2019m pushing 50 dammit\u2026 I was SO relieved that I was no longer \u201cin the game\u201d and that I had a partner who I loved in every which way; looks, style, attitude, beliefs. One used to say \u201cTogether\u201d and the other would reply \u201cForever\u201d.    I don't want to meet another person but I also don't want to die alone.  I have no idea where to go from here guys...  PS. For what it's worth, I did what I could with the hand I was dealt. We agreed with my wife to be the best co-parents we can be for the sake of our child and I honestly decided that I don\u2019t hate her for what she\u2019s done. She is the mother to my child and that will never change.    We formally signed a coparenting agreement and as it stands, my son will be coming over to me in the summer when schools close.    I am also now trying desperately to learn the language with online courses and looking for remote positions but my chances of getting a job in the uber competitive local job market are astronomically low, even if I do speak the language. But I sure as hell want to try and make it.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1jwl2qb/ever_had_to_rebuild_your_whole_life_from_square/", "date":"2025-04-11", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenX", "sentiment":"neutral"},

But on the bad end, I have a cataract in my left eye, which the optometrist says they shouldn\u2019t remove for another 10 years. Damaged oil ducts that don\u2019t allow the oil to come out with the tears to keep my eyes sufficiently lubricated (a healthy eye stays moist for 10 seconds, mine is 2 in the left eye and 3 in the right), which results in massive dry eye to the point where I always have a white film over my vision and my left eye feels like it has a thin layer of scratchy fabric wrapped around it, like the eyeball is just slightly bigger and I can FEEL it sitting in the socket. Optometrist says the only treatment is an off-label laser that\u2019s not covered under insurance and would start around $1500, depending on the number of sessions, and it\u2019s generally only 50% successful. Massive amounts of floaters that cause gray waves to obscure my vision. Downtime for that surgery alone is 2 weeks off of work, and Google says that, get this, most people who have the surgery will develop cataracts within 2 years. And I\u2019m finally starting to hold my phone further out to read it, so I guess bifocals will come soon.

No one ever told me these things, and I don\u2019t want other women to go through what I did.  Lichen Sclerosus (LS) is a chronic skin condition that affects the genital area\u2014often in postmenopausal women\u2014and many of us have never even heard of it. It\u2019s easy to mistake for \u201cjust menopause stuff,\u201d but it\u2019s not.  The most common symptoms:  * Intense itching, especially around the vulva or anus * White, shiny, or thin-looking skin * Cracks or tears in the skin (like paper cuts) * Burning or pain, especially during urination or sex * Changes in appearance of the genitals over time  You might need to look with a mirror or take a photo to see it clearly. Some people never even notice the symptoms until the condition has already caused damage.  # So why does it matter?  Because LS is progressive and causes permanent scarring if untreated.  **Over time, the skin can fuse together, the clitoral hood may close over, and the vaginal opening can narrow or even seal shut.** **Left unchecked, LS can cause irreversible anatomical changes and pain. And while rare, it also increases the risk of vulvar cancer.**  The good news?  LS can be managed effectively with a topical prescription steroid ointment, usually applied daily or a few times per week long-term. Treatment helps prevent scarring, reduces symptoms, and lowers cancer risk. The earlier you catch it, the easier it is to manage\u2014and the less permanent damage you'll have.  If you\u2019re having any of the symptoms above, or even just a feeling that something isn\u2019t right\u2014please ask your doctor. You may need to advocate for yourself. Many general practitioners aren\u2019t familiar with LS or may brush it off as \u201cnormal aging.\u201d But it\u2019s not something to ignore.

Die Hard has been remade and transformed, but we were the originals who got to see it for the first time!  We had  Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman their prime. Heck we got to see Alan Rickman in his first major role. We saw Bruce Willis with hair!  We saw Tom Hanks in Bosom Buddies.   We were kids when the original Star Wars still had Hans shot first!  Jurassic Park, Die Hard, Indiana Jones, A Christmas Story, the original Robocop, Big,  Terminator, Say Anything!, The Princess Bride,  any John Candy movies!  John Hughes movies were our gig!  We grew up with some of the best. Many were from peeking over when our older siblings were watching or dragging us along.   We existed before PG-13, so we saw a lot more than we should have.   We are a generation that saw the reruns of the Boomer actors and still had our own.  We saw the old John Wayne movies on TV reruns, but had John Cusack and our actors.   We had the cool original TV shows that hadn't been thought before - original writing!  Knight Rider, Dukes of Hazard, Remington Steele, the A-Team, all those shows that have tried to be remade and mostly failed. The current ones are frequently just bad remakes of the original concepts we actually saw first.   We are the kids who marveled at the modem sound, patiently waiting for the AOL, you've got mail!  We actually knew what it all was when we heard the start of the movie of the same name!    We had the D&D games in our nerdfests, drivers licenses eagerly awaited instead of put off for years, cruising around, under 21 dance clubs, video rental places where you saw other people, microwave popcorn was new but jiffy pop was better, and even the new concept of being able to record your favorite TV show!!!  We were the last generation of kick the can, board games, PE playground fun, art class, thinking \"Pong\" was the greatest, bike riding everywhere, staying out until the bell rang or your mom called, having neighbors you knew, staring at the clouds overhead while laying in the grass, library story days, and reading books, actual hardback, paper page books.  We didn't have social media, you didn't hear about the extreme anxiety causing so many disabilities, your bigger sibkimg stood up for you.   There are a lot of good things in the world today, but we were the generation who had the firsts.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1jw9wx2/feeling_happy_that_im_not_20/", "date":"2025-04-10", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenX", "sentiment":"positive"},

Wash hair, then towel dry a little. Scrunch in mousse, then blow dry upside down while scrunching hair towards the root. Use a curling iron to curl hair back from face, then curl half the fringe (bangs) down and half back. (Hot rollers are also an option) Hairspray. Use a comb to tease the curls, also tease while upside down. Take a round brush to the fringe. Hairspray, and lots of it. Flip head up and down like at a heavy metal concert and then hairspray again. Also use a comb to pull out side sections of hair and hairspray to get \"wings\".  Let me know if there's anything I missed or anything I got wrong!

And it wasn't just a case of parents not paying attention to what the kids were watching; my parents actively took me to see a lot of this stuff in the theater! In hindsight, a lot of these were actually pretty good movies. They were just wildly inappropriate for small children.  Here are a few that particularly traumatized me, along with the original trailers:  The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWCO\\_PdJMao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWCO_PdJMao)  Asylum/House of the Crazies: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6uGmQVa3yM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6uGmQVa3yM)   The Omen: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS-sXcx30O4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS-sXcx30O4)   Invasion of the Body Snatchers: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc\\_0dlmSq7I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc_0dlmSq7I)   Coma: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqUxB2l6N\\_Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqUxB2l6N_Q)   The Amityville Horror: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75irzlk2HyU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75irzlk2HyU)   These were all from the 1970s, and the \"horror\" aspect wasn't just gore or jump scares. Rather, these were deeply disturbing psychological horror films! I think the 80s is when the more formulaic slasher type movies became the rage (Friday the 13th, anything with Jamie Lee Curtis, etc). But it got me wondering about the culture at the time. Was horror a huge part of 1970s culture? Or was I just exposed to an unusual amount of it? I remember other kinds of films too, like comedies, but there was just so.much.horror. I grew up to really enjoy creepy/spooky/disturbing stuff, but I would never let a small child watch any of this.   Did you watch an inordinate amount of scary stuff when you were a little kid, and did you grow up to hate it or like it? Did your parents actively encourage you to watch it? The more I think about it the stranger it seems, but at the time it felt totally normal, even if it was a sort of low-key constant trauma.", "link":"None", "date":"2025-04-08", "image_url":"https://i.redd.it/ymsolwijhmte1.jpeg", "generation":"GenX", "sentiment":"neutral"},
 {"id":290, "title":"HBD Twin Peaks!", "content":"35 years ago today, something happened that affected me profoundly. April 8th, 1990 I was going to graduate high school in one month. I couldn't wait. School was a total drag for me, and unless you were a jock or postponed living to get great grades, you were sh*t-out-of-luck around here in the late 20th century.   I am talking about one of the greatest TV events in history: Twin Peaks debuted on ABC! I was familiar with David Lynch through Erasurehead (a rite of passage that I hope is still honored today), and Dune (which is unfairly maligned IMHO).   Twin Peaks blew my mind then, and blows my mind now. There was a very small group of fellow weirdos and malcontents that I hung out with who would watch it weekly, and discuss the show at school the next day. I couldn't believe that ABC actually put Twin Peaks on the air! Still can\u2019t.This was Morning In America FFS! My mom was convinced that it was an evil show even though she never watched it with me. This was a common misconception among the adults who were convinced that there were Satanists in every patch of woods recruiting teenagers to eat babies and dance naked, that AIDS was floating around in every public water municipality, and that the bathrooms were breeding Bolcheviks.

I remember spending time with him in the garage from the time I could stand up, taking things apart, while he fixed things.

My first memories of his car was this British racing green(primary color)Volkswagen Beetle, 61-62, don\u2019t rightly remember, but it was rusty as hell. I recall mom getting a call from the hospital, because dad had put his foot through the floorboard of that car, and lost his shoe, part of his toe and most of his heel. But he didn\u2019t wreck the car. He was back up in a few weeks and while he still used a cane, we went to the junk yard and bought all the parts to fix the floor boards. He took the body off in the garage using an overhead hoist, and rolled out the chassis, and his friend came over and welded in the sheet metal patches. He also replaced the engine in that car a few times. About 10 years later, he got a pair of Toyota Starlets, for $500, he kept on in the back yard for part for the other one and drove that until 2012 when mom died. He sold everything and moved to another state. Was anyone else\u2019s dad like this?

In the meantime, I've been monitoring and keeping logs of my blood pressure and sugar levels to show my PCP when I see them. Be well, Redditzens! Love you!

Then my cat came and laid on my chest. She's a new addition to our family and has never done that before. Anyway, I'm  petting her head, and then all of a sudden my heart is racing! Like 140-170 bpm! I feel lightheaded, but no pain or shortness of breath at all. Every time I move my heart rate spikes, so I lay down on my couch and call my bestie over (she lives 2 houses down from me). She takes my blood pressure and it's high, so off to the hospital we go!   After a few hours, an x-ray, an EKG, and blood tests, everything comes back normal, so thankfully no signs of a heart attack.   The doctor seemed to think it was an anxiety attack, but recommended I see a cardiologist, just to be sure. I've never had a thing like this happen to me before, so to say I was quite scared would be an understatement.  Has anyone else already had a minor or major health scare?

Not one single person told their parents. We also asked if anyone had ever told their parents when they were almost maimed/killed as a result of some stupid shit we were doing for fun.

 {"id":401, "title":"My retirement has been delayed a Decade - I've lost 40 percent of my Net Worth since early February", "content":"Just curious if anybody else is as fucked as I am.  So, the good news, I suppose, is that my 40 percent net worth loss is just on paper. I haven't panic sold (yet). There's like 5 different times where I *should* have panic sold. I would have been much better off, but now I feel it's too late.  I'm currently 54. Originally, I was hoping to retire last December. Then I was thinking I'd retire this December for sure, or maybe December 2026 as a worst case scenario.  Now, it's looking like my retirement could be delayed another decade, if not cancelled completely.  It's pretty amazing how quickly this has happened. I was looking at my stock portfolio in early February, and it was at an all-time high. My net worth was slightly more than 1 million at that time. (maybe 80k over 1 million).  Now.... don't get it twisted. I'm not even close to being rich or wealthy (or more accurately *was* rich or wealthy). Yes, my net worth did hit 1 million about 70 something days ago, but I don't own any property. Every penny I have is basically in the stock market. I live by myself in an apartment.  I make basically no money. The only good news I can say is that I work for the government and thus have a good healthcare plan. I will also get a very tiny pension, when I finally do retire. That's pretty much the end of the good news. I'm paid a measly $25 per hour in my office job for the government (that's my gross per hour, lol) My pension, if I was to retire right now, might be $1200 per month, but possibly a bit less after some deductions. Assuming Social Security exists when I'm 62 in another 7 or 8 years, I'd get another $1200 for that.  I'm not even a full-time employee. I only get about 30 hours per week.  My monthly spend is about $2600. I actually make about $2350 or so after taxes per month, so I have a shortfall of $250 per month. (I've been taking out money from my portfolio to cover my monthly shortfalls)  I live in a very high cost of living location in Northern California. A relatively mediocre 3 bedroom 2 bath house with 1500sq in a \"decent\" neighborhood is about 700k here. If you want a \"good\" neighborhood, it's more like 1.2 million. You can't find a one bedroom apartment for less than $1400-ish, unless you go to a legit ghetto type area where there's gunshots nightly.  I'm lucky in the fact that I got a 2 bedroom apartment in a decent area back in 2021. I'm paying $1450 per month for my apartment. I spend no money on ANYTHING basically. Just bills and food. Nothing else. I haven't been on any vacation since the summer of 2019. I don't spend money on clothes, gadgets, streaming services, video games, movie theaters, restaurants, sporting events, concerts, you name it. I basically stay home 24/7. I go for long walks to help with my mental health/boredom. I'm divorced with no money to try to pursue dating. I tried online dating a few times, but it was a complete waste of time.  Anyways, shit is really, really, really bad, but I guess things could be even worse. I could be living under the freeway overpass. I see people every single day that are living under the freeway overpass. They're only about a mile from where I'm living. I walk by them on my way to the grocery store.  My physical condition is really good, although my diet is pretty shitty. I don't have the money for high quality protein sources, or good vegetables and fruits. I still buy fruits and veggies when I can get them on aggressive sales, but it's getting more rare.  Just curious if anybody else is as ass-out as I am. I'm not looking for any pity or anything. Nobody put a gun to my head and forced me to have my entire portfolio in tech stocks. Nobody put a gun to my head and forced me to have a low paying job. I made my bed and I'm sleeping in it.

I'm much better now than when I originally posted it to /r/agingparents). Suicide in elderly parents is extremely common that I want people our age to be more aware of)  On a Saturday two years ago I talked to my Dad and everything seemed fine. He was relatively healthy but had what I'd thought was a few elderly moments of forgetfulness. On Sunday I got a call that he'd shot himself.  The thing is, I knew that there had been studies about the risk of suicide really rising among the elderly, especially older men. I'd said to my Dad a few months before that I wanted him to consider getting rid of his guns as he no longer was in a place where he needed them, or at least transferring them to me. He never got around to it and I'd forgotten about the conversation. This is a guy who was always positive and so successful, and family and friends just can't understand how a person can so successfully hide what is going on in their brain that they'd offer no clues what they were thinking of.  The usual messaging about reaching out for help to a hotline I think may be more effective on younger people. My Dad absolutely knew he could count on his companion or his kids to take care of him. He knew he could reach out any time of day or night and we'd help however we could.  Losing a parent is hard for all of us. Perhaps this is actually an easier way than years or decades of medical care, which is what my Dad was really afraid of. But it still leaves us all behind wondering why or what we could have done differently...  I finally have a use for [this Reddit post on Grief and Loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend_just_died_i_dont_know_what_to_do/c1u0rx2/) that I loved but had at that point only shared with people.

I\u2019m the next generation to die. And it\u2019s fucking killing me, no pun intended.

With that out of the picture, I have a lot of anxiety buried inside. My work/hobbies keep me busy enough, but the future I\u2019m working towards seems daunting.   The only thing that seems hopeful is maybe AI will provide support. I chat with an AI and it\u2019s already been a helpful crutch.

What malls do you remember that really stick out in your mind or meant something to you?   We had so many malls  in our region there must\u2019ve been at least 20 within easy driving distance\u2026 About an hour or so\u2026 But I\u2019ll give you the top three that really stick out in my memories\u2026   1\u2026 beaver Valley Mall, Beaver Pennsylvania. I am told by my parents that this was the first mall I ever  visited, and it definitely is the first mall I am aware of in my memories. It was a two level mall and what really stands out to me is that in   the atrium/mezzanine openings they had tall two story birdcages made of iron bars with a vast ray of tropical birds living there. Tons of parrots macaws and others. it was definitely a key attraction and probably went a long way to keep kids from constantly complaining about having to walk from store to store for what seemed like back then hours and hours.  2\u2026 Myrtle Square, Mall, Myrtle Beach SC Overall this was a rather plane and small mall that we visited while we\u2019re on vacation. The one thing I remember most about it is the central atrium was one giant clock\u2026 Around the border of the Dome skylight were 60 lights or so that went up to mark the hour and minutes. I know there was a big number 12 but I can\u2019t remember anymore if it had numbers at each hour or just at the 3, 6, and nine slots. I also think that there was a secondhand series of lights that clicked around the dome but I\u2019m not sure if that was an accurate memory or not.  Underneath the clock dome where gigantic fixtures in the shape of gears Springs and other clock parts. I don\u2019t remember if this was some kind of intentional designated playground but I do know that climbing on these clock parts was a popular activity. Another fond memory is that there was a magazine new stand store in one corner of the mall with comic books spinner racks, and it was there that I learned as a seven-year-old in 1977 that the Star Wars comic book had gone from being a movie adaptation miniseries to a regular monthly title!  3\u2026 monroeville mall, Monroeville Pennsylvania. Another early two level  mall, it\u2019s not the two levels or the ice-skating rink in the center that really makes thismall stand out in my mind. It was this mall\u2019s appearance in the 1979 zombie movie \u201cDawn of the Dead.\u201d My parents had done an extremely good job of making sure that I understood that movies and TV weren\u2019t real, but then they took me to a movie that didn\u2019t take place in some far off almost mythical place like New York or Los Angeles but in a mall that I regularly visit it! It now has a distinction of the only horror movie that ever bothered me to this day I still have trouble eating pastas and things like chili or beef con Carne because it reminds me of the blood and guts the zombies were eating in that film.

 {"id":683, "title":"I used to use my cable box in other houses! \ud83d\ude42", "content":"I was born in September 1973 in northeast Ohio, and I was fortunate enough to have a TV and cable box in my bedroom as a teenager.  At that time, Warner Cable had two models of cable boxes; they had a simple box that didn't do much other than serve as a way to be able to have a remote control for your older TV that didn't have its own remote control, and they also had a larger, more sophisticated box that enabled you to watch certain channels that needed descrambled, such as HBO, a pay-per-view event, and so on. That 2nd box is the one I had.  Well, from the winter of 1987-88 until the spring of 1989, I used to take my cable box over to others peoples' houses and hook it up there. What this did was make it so that all of the channels that could be descrambled and watched were suddenly available to you. This means you could watch HBO, Showtime, The Movie Channel, and Cinemax. Apparently, your own personal cable box that you had for your own cable subscription in your own house did not recognize the subscription of a different location, so, your cable box reacted by simply descrambling every possible channel that there was. That is how I was able to see all those premium channels with my own box at other people's houses. That was especially fun when you consider that, in my own home, I didn't have a subscription to any of those channels.  By the spring of 1989, I think that the cable company figured out that people were doing that, and they put a stop to it. Before long, hooking my box up at someone else's house did not do anything. But it was fun while it lasted! And as a teenage boy at the time, it was fun staying over at someone's house and watching ours of HBO, Showtime, The Movie Channel, and Cinemax for free!   This trick also worked in reverse, too; if a friend brought their box to your house, the same would apply!  Did any of you figure out this trick also? And if so, did you do what I did, stay overnight at someone else's home and watch hours of those channels and have fun?

Came home from work two days ago, only to find my beloved partner of sixteen years had passed away sometime that afternoon, at the age of 58.  Right now I'm busy dealing with arrangements, and have been surrounded by friends and his wonderful family. Constantly hosting people who are checking in on me, speaking on the phone and answering texts feels like a full time job right now, and I truly appreciate how kind and caring everyone has been. But I know that in time that support network will gradually ebb away, because life goes on for them as it will for me, and I'll have to face up to the fact it's just me and the cat now.  I'm so hurt that I'll never get to see him again, that it happened so suddenly, and that I wasn't there with him. We still had so many plans and dreams for our future, and now they're all gone. He was the kindest, most gentle soul, and I know at some point I'm going to feel furious that, yet again, one of the good ones was taken too soon. I just don't know what I'm going to do, or how my life will look without him by my side any more?  Please, everyone, cherish every single moment you have with your partners and spouses. Make the most of every single day together, and let them know how much they're loved and how much they mean to you. One day all you'll have left are your memories of them, so make them count.  xx  Update:  Didn't think this was going to gain so much traction. I've learned a lot, not least of all that losing a partner or spouse way too early is far more common than I would ever have thought... quite humbling.  Although I haven't replied individually yet (it's still a bit too raw for me now, but maybe in time), I've read every single response, and will keep on doing so. So many terribly sad and unfair stories, but I'm glad others have been able to share their experiences too, and talk about the love they still hold for their partners and the hope they have for finding acceptance and healing.  xx", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenX/comments/1jltcy9/lost_my_partner_way_too_young/", "date":"2025-03-28", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenX", "sentiment":"negative"},

Gone for 3-6 months at a time. I got home the other day, and stopped into my local for my haircut, only to find my Barber died 3-4 months ago. I liked him OK, he knew exactly what i wanted and I didn't need to show him a photo of past haircuts. Granted, he told me a mildly racist joke 6 years ago, but when i told him my GF was black and I'd done volunteer work in Africa for several years, he apologized, backed off, and  and we had decent conversations since then. I even brought him around a bit on racial issues. The barbershop has 2 barbers and i while I prefer the other guy (who never talks) his work was average, and my guy knew my style and did it perfectly every time. Best of all, both barbers brought their dogs to the shop and everyone knew the two dogs as well as they knew the two barbers.  Now, the line is out the door due the 50% drop in barbers, and I didn't feel like waiting (5th in line!!), so I said my condolences and (due to lack of barbershops), i had little choice but to try and book at the local SportsClips near the Walmart. NIGHTMARE! I need to join their website just to book a haircut. They wanted my email, phone, and other nonsense. I can't even book right now, because their website won't let me book until they open tomorrow morning. The last time i went there (10 years ago), my female barber spent my entire cut talking about her BF's pickup (or Jeep, I don't recall) and what he'd tricked it out with. The cut was a mess and I thankfully discovered the 2-dog shop down the road shortly after. Been going for almost a decade, no issues.  IDK why I need to join a website, choose an appropriate password, divulge my personal info and schedule a cut online just to get a haircut for 50% more than I was paying before. I know SportsClips has shops everywhere, but I miss just walking into a **men's barbershop**, taking a seat, bullshitting about local and national politics with the others waiting, watching the latest Tom Cruise drama on the big screen, and getting exactly the haircut I wanted in less than 15 minutes.   Anyways, that's my rant. Hopefully, the remaining barber will find a replacement (with dogs) soon and i can go back to getting a haircut the way it was meant to be, without a website wanting to know my personal information.

Bask in the glory of the 1980's with spandex jumpsuits and AquaNet hair! Rail is still around today, with the four original members, but never broke through beyond a regional audience.  **Rawhead** \\- [\"Staring At The Sun\"](https://youtu.be/7gCmIdIgzfs?si=N8mTI5dKPDBAPJrf). The 1980s were a time of change for the Seattle metal scene. Rail at the front of the 80s and Rawhead closing out the decade with one of the finest hardcore metal tracks ever recorded.

The [general consensus](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenerationJones/s/JzWeYwD22w) seems to be:   - **1981** because that\u2019s when MTV launched, which was a game-changer. Music videos became a huge part of pop culture, and bands like Duran Duran and Pat Benatar helped shape the Gen X vibe. MTV made it clear that the new generation was carving out its own identity, separate from the Boomers.  - But others also suggest **1983** as the tipping point. That\u2019s when fashion, music (like Thriller by Michael Jackson), and the overall attitude of the time made it obvious that Gen X had fully arrived.

The other person mentioned that him and his wife are looking into Malaysia or Spain as potential retirement spots. He said that due to caring for sick parents before they passed that a lot of their retirement savings are not as large as they had hoped for and so retiring overseas is the best option to live a nice retirement on much less than what it would take here in the US.

I'll be right with you.\" Then she yelled back at the Bouncer.  \"Who's Birthday is it?\"  He pointed us out.  \"It's that guy right there.\"  Carla responded, \"Who, where?\"   The bouncer came over and pointed me out again. \"This guy right here.\" Then he walked away. My girlfriend expected the worst.   Carla looked dumbfounded.

Juniors got heckled (more good-naturedly). And then the Seniors would belt-out the school fight song, ostensibly louder, and better than any of the others.  Sept. \u201985, the start of my senior year. Annual homecoming pep rally. The usual drill. But more of a lacklustre participation across the board.

Not a single member of my senior class sang that stupid fight song. Not a single, goddamn one. Not the jocks, not the kool kids. Nobody. 30 awkward seconds of the band playing, the football team standing on the dais, looking confused (some of them always looked that way to be honest). And I glanced around, needing visual affirmation of the what I was (or rather, was not) hearing.  The following Monday, school opened with an emergency assembly in the auditorium. We were all given a sternly worded lecture on school spirit. And told a \u201cmake-up\u201d pep rally would occur at the end of the day. Even though homecoming was over. A second Homecoming pep rally. And a new \u201ctradition\u201d trotted out. All four classes would sing the fight song together, in unison, as a show of solidarity (or so we were told). We all sang. I sang. But with some internal smugness.  10 years later, there was no reunion for my graduating class of \u201986. No one bothered. No one cared.  I still don\u2019t.

To a city where the same house that I grew up in is now 2x the price (and that happed in the span from 2015 to 2023), wages haven't increased all that much, tons of money flowed in with the spread of remote work, and home ownership is just too damn unaffordable.  I just saw a zillow listing for a 70 year old 850sq/ft house that has no garage, and the listing was for 360k. Absolutely absurd.  It just breaks my fucking heart to see what houses went for in 2020-2021 and prior. Full on single family homes that sold for 320k at 2.5% interest, now would be worth 500-550k at 7% interest.  That math just does not fucking math. I don't understand how anyone can afford to buy a house these days if they're not already backed with rich parents, and/or a ton of equity from riding the home appreciation wave from the 2010's.  The only \"affordable\" housing that I could maybe swing would be over an hour commute away from my job. And I already work 4 10's. I don't want to tie up 12 hours a day minimum on my work days doing that.  I can't believe that every generation before us just got to own a house.  Nothing special with their income.

The same idea applies to other areas: knowing when to delay gratification and when to simply allow yourself joy.  What powers do you think you've gained as your brain matured? Greater impulse control? The ability to integrate emotions without being overwhelmed or needing to suppress them? A reduced need for status games, conflict, or passive aggression? Less ego? Clearer communication instead of hinting? More diversified identity? More empathy and ability to see multiple perspectives? Being okay with being wrong/failure?

 {"id":1134, "title":"I feel like I missed out on everything", "content":"Warning: VERY UNDERDEVELOPED LONG RANT  Hi millennials! 17M Gen Z here. I've had recurring feelings of anemoia, ever since I was in middle school, for the decades in the 20th century. ESPECIALLY FOR THE 90's. I know it stupid to be hung up about, because I can't change my circumstances, but I feel like I've sorta been cheated out of an experience that I would have absolutely LOVED to be apart of.  Fortunately, since I was born in '07, I got to experience the last few remnants of an era and culture I long for. I used to have a 4:3 tv that I watched VCR and DVDs on, there was no technology in school except in computer typing class and when we watched those fuzzy quality safety videos, and my house had a built in house phone that I would use to call my mom at work often(you'll notice I talk about technology a lot). Unfortunately, that era seemed to die out when I was 9, and I wasn't fully conscious until I was three, so those fuzzy memories only take up less than 5 years of my total life.  I can't help but feel cheated out even more due to the fact that my parents are older than my peers' parents. So much so that they could have children who would grow up in the 90's. In fact, my dad had two children with his first wife, and the younger child (my older half brother) was born in 1986, so we actually was a 90's child. However, my mom didn't even meet my dad until the late 90's, and theoretically, the farthest back that they could have birthed me was 2000. Not even 1999, goddamn.  My biggest \"complaint\" would be this era's technology. Yes, there are positives to having faster, on demand, and easier to use accessible technology.....but it kinda just make things boring? Cause yk what, having to flip through 100 pages of an encyclopedia to find out where babies come from honestly seems a lot more rewarding to me than just searching it up for two seconds on Google. I feel like such a boomer saying this (which is kinda ironic) but I hate the fact that certain things are so much easier to do, but it kinda takes the joy out of doing it. I don't have to make a lemonade stand in order to save up for  a record from my favorite band, because I can just scroll and find it immediately on Spotify (fun fact: my childhood dream was to make a lemonade stand....it never happened). It's not the destination, it's the journey or some shit. Plus, coming from a Gen Z, I feel like the imperfect, fuzzy technology of past decades brought so much personality and and certain tone that gives me so much serotonin whenever I look at it. Every old picture, video, etc.  I know that I'm looking at this through rose-tinted glasses a little. Yes there were bad stuff about the 90's, as with every decade (for starters, I would have been heavily bullied because....well just look at my PFP). However, that still doesn't stop my desire to go back to that era of human history. The culture just feels more connected to me than the culture we have right now. But no matter how many times I decide to leave my phone at home, or watch old sitcoms, I'm brought back to the reality of my situation everytime I go back into public. That the culture I love has been gone for a long time, and it won't come back just because I never actually experienced it.  I want to go out with friends for hours without having my anxious mom calling me every 5 minutes. I want to explore an imperfect version of technology that held a certain mystique to it. I want to stop being anxious to talk to my peers because I can't help but think about how they have a better alternative of entertaining themselves than talking to me, right at their fingertips. And I want to experience every historical/iconic cultural moment of the 90's, whether it be good or catastrophically bad, instead of just hearing from others that it had happened. I get so jealous whenever I look at old media, or hear stories of things that happened way before I was born, because I guess I just wasn't as fortunate as some people to be born back then in a simpler time. I feel like I've been born after every innovation and important historical moment has happened, and everything feels stagnant and it sucks. It doesn't even feel like the present anymore. Time keeps on moving, and with that, I'm moving farther and farther away from the nostalgia that I was never actually apart of, and into a future that I'm honestly not so fond of at the moment.  Sometimes I fantasize what it would be like to be born just 20 years earlier. I feel like I would have had a lot more memories for nostalgia to cling onto honesty, because now, my experiences feel inauthentic. Idk I'm exaggerating way too much and being all pitiful. But I've felt this way for a long time now, and I just kinda have to go with the flow.  Are there any GenZ out there that feel the same way I do?

Pretty boy \"pop star looking\" characters come off as flamboyant or queer coded, while grungy alt kids and skater girl tomboys come off as butch.  I actually found this interesting *Batman* related analysis on Tumblr that explains the difference between how Stephanie Brown had been depicted. When introduced in 1993, she was a latchkey gen xer/early millennial who knew how to sew because she was self-reliant and independent. By the late 2000s, she had become a mid millennial and lost that trait.  https://fantastic-nonsense.tumblr.com/post/778857650696912896/amp", "link":"None", "date":"2025-04-10", "image_url":"https://i.redd.it/14f6x1a4b1ue1.jpeg", "generation":"millennials", "sentiment":"negative"},

My best friend and his wife just took his kids to Disney World. They are my age, right at 40, so older Millennials.  They both went as kids and loved it as well.       When they got back and both said they hated the trip. They said everything was geared towards getting them to spend money. Everything is a store, every line can be bypassed for a few extra bucks, every store is geared towards fear-of-missing-out for the kids. Specialty cups. Specialty \"only available this week\" shirts, and special pins and buttons that you can only get this year. They said it was the most uncomfortable vacation they have ever been on. And they have more money than they know what to do with.   They basically said that there wasn't 20 minutes where they weren't being sold something.

As I was writing the post, I realized the only people I regularly saw on Facebook were older friends and my family members. My best friends and I communicate separately via messenger and text. They already knew about the job and congratulated me. Who was I posting for? So that day in deleted my Facebook app and never looked back. I still use Instagram.

Would that be of interest to anyone? I can't find an existing Discord server that serves this purpose so i'm just asking if there's interest.  Also - i'm not  one to make this a feeding ground of negativity. Venting doesn't have to be about negativity. It can be healthy when surrounded by empathy and positivity. Maybe the answer is to just go for a walk. But I still hope that there's millennials out there who would want to connect on things like this and lend an ear to each other.

I applied to this department as an Admin Assistant, expecting that I\u2019ll do admin work for the rest of my work life. But since we lack manpower, my bosses asked me to also be a liaison officer temporarily, which earns 3x my salary. I accepted it since I am a new hire at the time, and since I thought it was temporary.  6 months later, I am still doing 2 jobs, but leaning more on the liaison work. I gave up the admin side of my job because the liaison work requires 3/4 of my time. Again, my salary is still aligned with my admin assistant job.  When my office still hasn\u2019t hired any LO til now, I tried to apply. I mean, I\u2019m already doing the job for 6 months and I also want a pay raise. But the HR and my boss wasn\u2019t supportive, since I lack 3 months more of work experience (minimum is 3 yrs). As a boss, I think he should know that I deserve that part, regardless of the work exp. requirement. He has the power to tell the HR or even hold the position if he believed in me. Everyone in the office pushed me to apply, cause they also think that it is unfair for me to do 2 roles with that kind of salary. It\u2019s really not easy.  Fast forward, with the use of my connections, I was endorsed by the Senate President. Lo and behold, my boss knew it and got angry at me. He said he was bypassed. He said indirectly that he would never consider me in that LO position. Right now, they hired one LO, but she came from a different office in the same department I\u2019m working now.

 {"id":1303, "title":"The Fourth Turning", "content":"Please do yourself a favor and read this book called the Fourth Turning by William Strauss and Neil Howe.  For all the people that have felt like they have continuously gotten the short end of the stick in life, life has constantly beat you down, kept your wages low, still live at home with your family, have never had the opportunity to buy your own home...blah, blah, blah...it's not you. You're not the problem. You're doing great.  This is a book that goes on to explain these social cycles in life specifically for Americans dating back to the late 1400's. Every 21 years or so there is a new generation that is born. There are 4 generations within a cycle that are labeled archetypes (Prophet, Nomad, Hero, and Artist). You can think of these cycles like the 4 seasons. Every 85-105 years there is a secular turning, or the ending/beginning of a new cycle. Well, we were born in the 3rd portion of this current cycle, and we enter our young adulthood in the 4th turning. The fourth turning is like winter, and it is a crisis cycle. The Hero enters the crisis cycle in young adulthood.  This book is theory. It was written in 1997 and predicted that in about 10-12 years there would be something that would happen that would mark the beginning of the fourth turning or the beginning of the crisis cycle. Can you think of something major that happened about 10 years after '97? The housing market crash. This book predicts that this crisis cycle would last about 20-25 years. It goes on to predict that the cycle will end very badly...I hope the worst that will happen will ONLY be a trade war. If this theory is correct, then our timeline will follow the trend from previous generational cycles. Meaning, we will have hit our lowest points in our societal lives and will last for the next few years. After this crisis ends, it's all up hill! This will be the time for millennials to start seeing the changes that we want in our lifetime.  I haven't even finished reading this book yet, but this book gives me a lot of hope that sometime beginning now, and possibly over the next few years will be the lowest points of my life in regards to our society. I can't wait until we as millennials will really begin to see the changes that WE want.

When I was 13 someone tried to abduct me in the guise, of a caterer?, he was trying to get me to come and see the food in his van. I knew he was trying to kidnap me but I was so desensitized to perverts that it didn\u2019t even phase me. I just kept walking and told him no until he fucked off. I\u2019ve woken after partying, up to a man eating me out and I just moved like he was waking me up so he\u2019d have the opportunity to stop. I remember going to a store and wanting to try on a shirt as a 10 year old but the store man insisted he had to watch to make sure I didn\u2019t steal it. I knew he was a perv and refused him then stole the shirt out of spite. I\u2019ve been flashed in a store while shopping. I knew who the pervy uncles were to stay away as a child. I\u2019ve been raped at a party and chose not to do or say anything so as not to cause a scene. I\u2019m so used to perverts, molesters and rapists that it doesn\u2019t phase me or cause me distress. Every girl I grew up with has similar stories. Was this just normal for our generation or is this abnormal? I mentioned just a snippet of what I went through to my boyfriend and he was horrified and asked me to stop telling him my stories. I wasn\u2019t emotional or anything because for me it was normal and I\u2019ve always been hyper aware.   ***EDIT***  I just finished reading all of your posts and wanted to say thank you all for sharing your stories and experiences. Sadly I\u2019m not surprised at how we all have a story or know someone else that\u2019s gone through something. Reflecting on this more now I realize it\u2019s definitely not just our generation, this is an issue all women know no matter the era we grew up in. I just hope that all the awareness now helps our children and future generations to not just be desensitized and feel shamed by their abuse and that when they speak up they are heard and perpetrators are punished.   To all the women who have not been SA/harrassed/abused in some way, good! I am genuinely so grateful that there are women who are able to live  without the experience of SA and all the baggage that comes with it. The shame the guilt and the distrust. That should be the norm not the exception. Every girl should be allowed to grow up and not have to fear male family/friends/teachers/strangers/co-workers/authority figures or expect to be abused by them in some way and feel like that\u2019s just part of life.   To all the men who have been sexually assaulted/abused in some form, that is another bag or worms. You have the trauma, guilt, shame in a whole different form than we do and I cannot begin to try and understand how it must have affected you or continue to affect you. I believe these are two separate issues, because even though the act and abuse may be the same type of sexual abuse the outcomes and consequences are different. In my opinion SA on boys/men is not worse or equal to what girls/women go through and vice versa. I have so much empathy for all male victims of SA and I hope the stigma of it disappears and more men feel safe and empowered to come forward and speak out.   Thank you all again for sharing!  Those wondering about my boyfriend - the reason he asked me to stop sharing was because it upset him so much to hear and i think he just needed a break to process, he has shared his empathy for me and my past. I think it just hurts him to hear and have no control to protect me from what happened. He\u2019s never experienced anything like what I\u2019ve been through and to him it must sound horrifying, to me it was just normal. I like to think that now i am a stable functioning adult, I have a family a house and a good career as a nurse. I think my hyper awareness , experiences, and knowledge growing up really saved me and hardened me to anymore abuse. I\u2019m not afraid to point out inappropriate behaviour or turn down unwanted advances anymore, I don\u2019t feel ashamed for what men have done to me. And I\u2019m not afraid to look my abusers in the eye and call them out. Im not afraid to expose abusers anymore either and I now feel empowered as a woman. Other women in my life also know i am a safe place for them and that i will stand up for them and i have many times.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1jrydgr/millennial_women_how_many_of_you_can_say_you_were/", "date":"2025-04-05", "image_url":"None", "generation":"millennials", "sentiment":"neutral"},

Both of them had rural properties with an absolutely insane amount of stuff they'd accumulated over the years. Broken trailers, piles of scrap metal, old pallets, decades worth of broken down vehicles, and every god damned cool whip container they ever bought.  My mom is in her 60s and was my grandmother's caregiver for the final few years of her life and has her older brother here on hospice right now. Us \"kids\" all in our 30s and 40s are here doing what we can to help out while saying goodbye to our uncle.  The cost and time and energy to get the properties cleaned up is no joke. I've been here for two weeks hauling trash and junk into rolloff dumpsters, throwing metal scrap into piles for the scrappers to come get, getting a motor home running again, cleaning out outbuildings on my mom's property to house all the tools from the outbuildings on the older generations properties. We also had to rewire most of my mom's house, I'll be rebuilding her front steps and part of her porch. I might be installing a new HVAC system as well if it gets here before I have to fly back home.  It was just too much for my mom to deal with at her age. I don't know what she would have done if us kids couldn't get here to help or if we lacked the skills to do all this work.  Don't do this to your kids as we age. If you're the type to accumulate projects you keep meaning to get around to let this be your wake up call to start getting them done at a faster rate then you get new ones or at least get them sold off at the first sign of elderly health issues. Handing a huge pile of half finished shit along with the mortgage to your next of kin isn't doing them any favors.  If you've got old boats, old cars or whatever parked out next to the shed that you haven't touched in several years just scrap them now. I guarantee your kids aren't going to fix up the old boat that hasn't run in twenty years. Yeah, I learned to water ski behind that boat and have fond memories associated with it but my grandpa bought the thing in the 70s and it hasn't run since he passed in 2012. I'm sure as shit not towing it from Arizona back to New York. And for the love of God write a fucking will. Don't make your kids have to deal with dividing up your sentimental possessions while grieving your loss.  I'm taking my own advice by the way. As soon as I get back home some things are changing on our property. My collection of tools and projects is getting much more organized and trimmed down.  Walk through your house and ask yourself how much work it would take to get your property ready to sell if you got hit by a bus tomorrow and your kids got stuck with your mortgage on top of their own living expenses. Be honest about how much your junk is worth at yard sale prices. I can tell you that most of it will probably be hauled straight to the dump.

 {"id":1489, "title":"Turning 33, feels weird.", "content":"Hey fellow millennials. As I start to write this, my birthday started 5 minutes ago. My partner and I found a cheap motel in a quaint beach town, enjoying the week of my birthday. The past 4 years we've had a tradition where we go somewhere regionally for 3-5 days to take a step back and just try to enjoy ourselves. You know the phrase: \"there's a little truth behind every just kidding\" ? My high school sweetheart used to say it all the time, and it has always been stuck in my head. I mention this because my partner and I have been talking about what I want to do for my birthday. I've mentioned seeing the sunrise and sunset, a nice brunch, crab legs for dinner, etc. She just asked me \"what time do you want to wake up tomorrow?\" I jokingly said, \"Never.\" And laughed it off. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I'm more serious about it than I think. As of January I'm unemployed, I've been coaching on the side and working for a family member part time to pay the bills. I have no motivation to \"get a real job\" anymore. This last one absolutely broke me. I was in an outside role visiting clients, and I suffered a pretty traumatic injury in my sport, couldn't walk unassisted for almost 8 weeks. I took a short leave during that time and the company was so supportive, and I had only been there 8 months, but I worked for a competitor prior, and I was doing better than 3/4 of the team. Started working again and setting meetings just to be let go. I had to threaten a lawsuit for them to even pay me what I was owed, no severance, heartless robots. Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage. This is hella ranty, and I'm not quite sure what my point is, but I'm the saddest and so devoid of hope internally. If it wasn't for my partner, the kids I coach, and our cats, I'd peace out on my 33rd. I've learned through therapy in the past year that the reason I'm so unhappy is that I don't care about myself. I'm over worrying about myself. I don't think I deserve anything good, all I want to do is make my friends and family feel seen and loved, and I'm finding that for about 10 years I've only cared about other people's needs and not my own. To provide a small example, my fianc\u00e9 went on a 2 week cleanse/diet where she was mostly eating fruits, veggies, and liquids. I typically only eat when we share meals together, and since she was all over the place and snacking and eating her portions, I found that I rarely made it a point to get myself some food. Money is tight, but no starving tight by any means. She was excited by the end of her cleanse because she lost about 7 lbs. She was very focused on not quitting and trying to hit all the metrics she didn't notice I wasn't eating, and I didn't notice either. I don't have any weight to lose, but she said she saw in my face I looked malnourished, and i had no idea. If you're still here, thank you.

Or, was your first experiences with online gaming on Xbox Live or the PS2?  Gen x and gen y gamers in general are in an interesting point where there are many different ways they could have been introduced to online gaming. Many didn't know you could play games online until the Xbox, while others were playing online in the early 90s. Some people were even doing it in the *80s*, though I imagine almost none of them were gen y.  For me, my first online gaming experience was actually the Wii U. Very late, I know, but I am basically a Nintendo-only gamer and Nintendo consoles have had a tricky time with online services. I spent so much time playing Splatoon that it broke my analog stick; my stick has mad drift due to all that Splatoon. Funnily, I haven't played Splatoon 2 or 3 online, because I don't feel drawn to pay for the online services. I played the solo modes and DLC, but not the main game.  Edit:  Okay, maybe that isn't technically right.   I experimented with child-friendly MMOs/virtual worlds in the 2000s as a tween and young teen. Millsberry, Bloo's Big Fat Awesome House Party, Petville, Pet Society, Fusion Fall, Poptropica, even Club Penguin for maybe a day. I also tried Habbo Hotel and IMVU a bit later.

I started seeing some blood where it shouldn\u2019t have been a couple months ago and figured it was just hemorrhoids. Turns out I have colon cancer. Luckily it hasn\u2019t spread and it should be treatable with surgery and maybe a little chemo. I have a kid and this is all really scary.   I had zero other symptoms and I got checked out right away. Of course, there\u2019s always a wait to get in with a GI and for the actual colonoscopy procedure. If I had waited longer and brushed it off the cancer would have been worse.  So if you\u2019ve been ignoring that bleeding or that weird poop, please stop ignoring it and get checked out. Colon cancer is on a major rise in younger people.  Also - the colonoscopy itself is So. Easy. Ask your doc for the Miralax prep. You take a couple laxative pills, mix some Miralax in a half gallon of Gatorade, and then you drink that and poop all night. The next day, they give you an IV, knock you out with the best happy sleepy drugs, and you wake up cozy and happy having no memory of being butt-probed. When people say it\u2019s \u201cthe best nap they ever had\u201d they are not lying. You\u2019re in and out within a couple hours.   It\u2019s so easy and could add decades to your life.

I'm going on year 4 of living out in a rural town outside of Philly. I would've never chosen a place like this. I prefer cities.  I had moved to Philly back in 2017, and things just went downhill for me big time. I made so many had decisions, and I was so stressed out of my mind that I chose to leave the city to get away from the excess stimuli and be closer to my job. Due to my income, I never saved up the money to move elsewhere after that. I'm bummed that I could've still been living in Philly this whole time. I could've left my current job sooner. I miss the city often, but my priorities have shifted now that I'm in my 30s. I'm reconsidering a lot things, and changing my lifestyle.    Recently, I've made the decision to move in with my Mother in 3 months. I'm looking forward to taking a break from the paycheck-to-paycheck life, and saving a ton of money. I have a plan for my finances and new hobbies.   After that phase, I made plans to move to Lancaster. I'm hoping things will go well for me there, and it'll be enough for me, considering my afinity for cities. I can't tell what environment I really want anymore (big city vs smaller city). I can't tell if I would mind dealing with big city problems again. With my career choice, I'd be commuting outside the city 5 days week, and I know what that's like in Philly. The traffic sucks. I also don't want to possibly deal with having less money, and more problems.  I just don't know anymore, so I'm going to go through with this plan, and hopefully I'll be happy. The upside is, I have plenty of friends and a good relationship with my family back in the York/Lanc/Hburg area. So there's that.   I tried to listen to any podcast that would help be during this transition in my life, and it didn't help that I learned that we are terrible predictors of what will make us happy. So, the best thing I can think to do is to make a smart financial decision.

It really is something that pulls you back to reality whether it be the news or current events or even a popular culture show either way you choose and it would be great to conglomerate amongst others that share you tv views or favs but tv can be great for a healthy dose of seeing an opposing worldview or opinion.

I\u2019ve been reading a lot of posts in this sub which are generally following a \u201cmid-life crisis\u201d theme. And trust me, I get it. Lots of what you all are saying is resonating with me. Experiencing 9/11 as young kids, 2008 financial collapse as we enter the workforce, dealing with absurd college loans, a horrible housing market, and COVID while some of us were starting families. It feels like we\u2019ve had to scratch and claw to get to this point while also serving as the bridge between gen Z and our parents generation.

HOWEVER, if you are at a crossroads, and feeling stuck\u2026now is the time to make a move and truly find out what\u2019s going to make you happy. Easier said than done, I know.  As someone working a corporate job in my mid-30s with 3 kids under the age of 6, I certainly feel beyond burnt out at times. I didn\u2019t have any lofty dreams as a kid, but having lost my dad to cancer as a teenager, I knew I wanted a family. And I wanted to try and give my kids more than I ever had. My 9-5 isn\u2019t incredibly fulfilling, but it allows me to do the one thing that I\u2019ve always known I wanted to do - make core memories with my family. I am fortunate to have a wife who I love very much and shares these same values. I have to remind myself this sometimes when I\u2019m feeling stressed at work, money is tight, and feeling worried about the general state of the world, but I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.

My best friend growing up lived right next door, so we were always available to one another, so we always did everything together. As we grew, we continued to be best friends, but as life has gotten more complicated over the years, we became less and less available, and some time in our twenties. We just completely lost contact. I still think of my best friend from day to day, wondering how he's doing, wondering if he has his own best friend now, etc.  It's just gotten me thinking of other people in our age group.

Confusing though, that the rest of the article past the opening paragraph is about Gen Z, and the financial support is for basic needs, like food, housing, and healthcare:  \u201cAbout 87% of those supporting Gen Z children give money for groceries and food; 73% spend money on their cell phone bills; and 69% contribute towards their health insurance. With skyrocketing housing prices, 66% are also stepping up to pay their Gen Z child\u2019s rent or mortgage. And to no one\u2019s surprise, they\u2019re covering education as well; 57% of parents fork over money for their Gen Z adult kid\u2019s tuition.\u201d  1) Not being able to afford basic needs is a top down problem, not a generational one. But nowhere in the article does it point out any of the systemic issues that caused Gen z and millennials to need financial help from their parents.

 {"id":1721, "title":"I don\u2019t understand how people have MONEY", "content":"**UPDATE: TL;DR LESSONS FROM THIS THREAD.**  Thanks, guys. Here is the breakdown of the hard truths from this thread. Basically, in order to have the real \"MONEY\" described in the OP below, it requires one or preferably, more than one of the following:  **Generational wealth:** Having parents pay for college and assist with downpayment on a house.  **Avoiding the student loan scam:** A lot of us 90s kids were brought up with the notion that college was everything and it would pay for itself later. Those with a more clear-eyed perspective realized what a trap student loans are and avoided them by either racking up the scholarships, going to the cheapest accredited school they could find, or figuring out a career path without a degree.  **Luck:** They secured a career job before the Great Recession and held onto it. Bonus points if they bought at the dip of the housing crash. They also seemed to avoid the avalanche of big ticket costs crashing down on them. Apparently nothing ever breaks and nobody gets sick.   **Exceptionally high-paying careers.** Self explanatory.  **Having miserable lives.** They work around the clock, and they never do anything but work, for the bulk of their physical prime. They don't go out with their friends, they don't have pets, they don't have kids, they never travel, and/or they live in tight spaces with roommates and no cars deep into their 30s. Or, they live in low-cost areas, which are few and far between in the United States, and these places don't have much going on in them (so nowhere to spend money anyway). **Caveat: some people are homebodies and that works just fine for them.** They don't spend money on travel or concerts or restaurants or weekend getaways because they don't need to. The 2020 Covid lifestyle was fine for them, content with a blanket, a cup of tea, and a book. Maybe this is the way (but I couldn't fathom the homebody lifestyle without a dog).  **Marrying/partnering well.** They found their partner early enough in life to not waste all the money paying for one's own place, and their partner also earns enough and saves.   **AS FOR MYSELF.** Much honestly deserved criticism here about the \"300K.\" I do not make $300K. That estimate was for another hypothetical budget in the optimistic situation that both me and my partner get promotions next year. Together we make just over $250K. But we don't officially live together yet. This will happen soon. If all goes well, we could be in good shape after a year or two. But I myself didn't hit six figures until 2022, and then plateaued at $125K grand total in 2024. And I didn't intend to make this about \"poor me,\" I'm doing above-average and could certainly do better with saving... the REAL question I should have been making more clear is that, given that I make more than average and find having the adequate savings exceedingly difficult, how do more average people do it? The answer appears to be that they don't, or if they do, they have one or more of the above.   **ORIGINAL POST STARTS BELOW.**  As in like, the recommended 6+ months worth of liquid cash savings, plus tens or hundreds of thousands to pay for a down payment on a house, and money to play around on the stock market or crypto if that\u2019s your thing.  I\u2019m in a good job and make an above average salary, but I take home just over half of it after taxes, healthcare, and 401k contribution (which is good that I do). My available savings fluctuates but I rarely ever have more than ten grand available. It all gets eaten up by mortgage and condo fees, dog and vet bills, (used) car payments, gas, utilities, groceries, random shit that needs fixing or replacing, medical deductibles, and god forbid I allow myself to go on a low-budget vacation once a year so I don\u2019t hate my life. I don\u2019t drink alcohol and I don\u2019t go clothes shopping except for maybe one or two new outfits a year. Could I buy fewer avocados and never leave the house? It could make a difference of a few hundred bucks every few months, but not the tens of thousands that I actually need.  People will blame \u201clifestyle creep,\u201d and I guess guilty as charged that I figure at 36 I have earned a car and a condo and not the life I had at 26, which was six roommates and a bike.

If you\u2019re a millennial then you\u2019ve almost certainly made your own Nickleback jokes before.  Ask a millennial which is the worst band of all time and most will at least consider saying Nickleback.  It was the only answer for almost a decade and kinda became a meme of sorts.        A few days back I fell into a rabbit hole after randomly coming across \u201cHow You Remind Me\u201d on the radio in a work truck.  Hadn\u2019t heard that song in well over a decade.  I was jamming out\u2026. So I went straight into their greatest hits on Spotify and I have to say\u2026. Man that was actually a good listen.  I knew damn near every word of many songs, even if i didn\u2019t recognize the titles.   And most of them had memories/feelings connected to them that I had long forgotten.        It got me thinking, where did all the hate actually come from?  Did some digging and they were actually one of the first victims of social media.   I forget the name of the comedian but while they were topping the charts he went onto a radio show and started talking about how much they suck and once celebrities got on board with reposting it absolutely exploded.  Social media was the Wild West at that time and celebrities had just gotten their voices.   We had no idea just how powerful it was at the time but before you know it\u2026 that\u2019s THE answer, across the country, for \u201cwho is the worst band of all time?\u201d      After chewing on it, I think most of it was due to over exposure.  There\u2019s a reason I know all those words to the songs even if I don\u2019t know the titles.  We couldn\u2019t get away from them.  lol.  I certainly don\u2019t miss those one hour rotations on the radio being the primary source for music.   But once it became cool to hate them it was all over.       TLDR-  Nickleback isn\u2019t that bad.  \u2026.I said it.        Edit: I think some of you misunderstood.  lol.  I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re the best band of all time.  It doesn\u2019t have to be one or the other.         Also, I understand that a lot of their music was misogynistic.   Just think about the other music at that time though.  When Eminem is the one setting the bar on misogyny\u2026 theres a lot of room for other stuff to slide under it relatively unnoticed.  Not an excuse but just an explanation as to how the songs were able to be played non stop on the radio without giving much thought to the lyrics.   \u201cThere\u2019s no direct references to murder, incest and/or rape?  \u2026.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\u201d", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1jkr6nx/nickleback/", "date":"2025-03-27", "image_url":"None", "generation":"millennials", "sentiment":"neutral"},

It will be an outline for anyone taking notes, but they will have to listen to my presentation to get any information. I will stand up and project my voice. I hate public speaking, but I had years of exposure therapy of giving presentations.     This has kind of ruined me, as now, when I attend trainings with Power Points, they all suck. They put all the information on the screen. And they just read off the PP. Most trainings I attend, they should just send over the PP, have us read it, and then have the presentation time just be a Q and A, as they give us all the information upfront.

 {"id":1780, "title":"The Broccoli Hair video edits", "content":"Hello fellow millennials,  I was wondering if I was the only one that noticed this trend.  Born in 1992 for reference.  So many content creators that I started watching back in the mid 2010's have shifted their video style, or their video edits to cater to a younger generation. I used to watch a YouTuber that uploads Mario Kart videos. Videos were really simple back then, just straight to the point. And then at some point, they changed their editors, and all of the sudden all these crazy edits, cuts, and sound effects were incorporated into their videos, and now I just cannot watch them anymore. And this trend has spread to so many other content creators that I used to watch. Yesterday, I was watching someone reviewing fast food chains, but instead of being informative and helpful, it turned into this random clips added into it, with a bunch of edits, and I feel like the video just completely missed the point.  I call it the Broccoli Hair edit, because I imagine that these kind of edits appeal to the broccoli hair kids, what can I say...  I also think this stems to TikTok, to make videos short and appealing, always, all the time. But maybe I am starting to show my age, because this trend completely turns me off?  So, have you noticed this trend also, and have you stopped watching some content creators because of this?

 {"id":1811, "title":"Why I am so afraid of intimacy and sex?", "content":"I'm from Argentina and I am currently living n NYC, and I'd love to connect with women here. But this brings up a deep frustration and anger I\u2019ve been carrying for years when it comes to relationships with women\u2014especially SEX.  I'm a 31 years old guy, I live alone, I take care of my appearance, and I've been told by friends and even several women that I'm good-looking. And yet, I've never had a girlfriend or \"dated\" anyone. I've only had two \"sexual encounters,\" but they were neither enjoyable nor satisfying due to the extreme anxiety that's been consuming my mind since adolescence.  Because of this, over the past 3\u20134 years, I've reached a point where I spend most of my days feeling sad, worried, frustrated, and full of self-hatred for not having solved this issue at my age. The thing that keeps my mind trapped is FEAR. That fear of intimacy and seduction simply won\u2019t go away. I'm still incredibly shy and anxious when talking to women (and people in general), which makes it nearly impossible for me to connect with anyone on a deeper level. Honestly, after thinking about this for so long, I\u2019m not even sure if it's just social anxiety and sexual anxiety or if it's a deeper emotional blockage. (I should mention that I suffered a lot of bullying as a kid, and I suspect it has unconsciously shaped my struggles with approaching women.  It feels as though I never developed \"emotional maturity\" in this area. Since most people experience their first relationships and sexual encounters in their teenage years, and that didn\u2019t happen for me, I feel stuck. Social media makes things even worse because it constantly bombards us with hypersexualized content, and I can\u2019t escape the overwhelming pressure. It leaves me feeling frustrated and powerless as a man\u2014like I\u2019m failing at something that should be natural. And as time goes by, it only gets harder. The fear grows stronger, and obviously, I can't just tell a woman that I've never had a girlfriend or any dating experience, because by now, most women have already accumulated a lot of experience just by being women.  I should clarify that I\u2019ve seen many psychologists and psychiatrists since I was 17. I\u2019ve tried every antidepressant and medication they\u2019ve prescribed, but NOTHING has worked. The worst part is that this isn't something I can talk about openly with just anyone. Therapists don\u2019t seem to know how to properly address sexual anxiety\u2014they just tell me, \"Go out and talk to women,\" but it\u2019s not that simple. Approaching someone and forming a connection that leads to intimacy requires much more than just talking.  I\u2019m considering seeing a sex therapist or trying some form of sexual therapy, but I honestly don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to hear the usual advice of \"just pay for a prostitute\" because that\u2019s not what I truly want. I've had Tinder for years, and while I get plenty of matches, nothing ever moves beyond that\u2014I just can\u2019t bring myself to meet anyone in person because of everything I\u2019ve described. I go out with friends regularly, and they\u2019ve tried to give me advice and introduce me to women, but I always end up avoiding the situation.

I just feel like if you're ok with your kid having a sleepover, especially more than 1 other kid, then you're signing up for noise for a night.

They also bought a house, raised four kids, and supported the whole family all with just one man's blue collar salary.  How times have changed, amirite?  For our generation, it's a different story:  * Instead of marrying the guy or gal down the street or from your church congregation, we're much more likely to attend college, meet people there, then move to a city and use apps to meet all kinds of potentials. There's no longer a narrow set of options we have to make do with. The infinite possibilities have made us more indecisive. * Now more than ever, marrying the wrong person can ruin your life financially. Several of us are drowning in student loan debt, but still can't get good-paying jobs. Housing, education, and raising children is more expensive than ever! Financial struggles have put a damper on finding the right person. * Expectations are higher and more complex than ever!

This makes me wonder if Millennials, including myself, struggle because we lack the resilience to handle adulthood's challenges or if we were set up to fail by previous generations and institutions that don\u2019t prioritize future improvements. Are our struggles a result of our own choices and lack of experience, or are they influenced by external factors? Do you feel confident and secure as an adult, or do things seem harder than what your caregivers faced?   My dad, who was born in 1960, often acknowledges that Millennials and Gen-Zers face challenges that are tougher than those of previous generations. This is then exacerbated by older gens drilling it into our psyches that we \u201chad it so good\u201d compared to what they experience therefore we are spoiled and weak when in fact we have been quite resilient and determined to better our lives and our world.

The Video Stores is gone, but that doesn't mean you can't have movie nights with friends still.  Most people now have televisions larger than we could have ever imagined in the 1990s.  With just a wifi signal those televisions have access to movie libraries that rivaled your video store.  You can round up your friends for a real movie night.  It's not even expensive, if everyone brings $5 in snacks, you will have a table covered with more junk food and soda than you can consume.  Time for your Lord Of The Rings Extended Marathon.

We actually have the tech available to us to have the most fun possible, that tech just also has the ability to encourage us to scroll and WISH we were having someone else's fun while we binge something while alone in a room, but no one says you have to do the scrolling.  Grow a group that does things in real life smaller activities.  You'll find that people actually like these things, they just lost momentum.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/1iwdqbk/successful\\_first\\_lan\\_party\\_in\\_my\\_basement\\_gaming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/1iwdqbk/successful_first_lan_party_in_my_basement_gaming/)  I've rounded up some tired ass millennial friends and friends of friends and we started playing Left 4 Dead 2.  Let me tell you it was a struggle to even round up a minimum of four players for the first time.  Had to cancel once because two got sick.  I finally had six players lined up, but one dropped out night before and another was a no show, we only hit the minimum of four.  ...And people had a blast.  Afterwards people who came were like 'Oh I have friends who'd be interested, I forgot how much fun this would be' and 'I'm bringing my siblings next time'.  Posted some pics on facebook of it happening and people were like 'Wow, can I come next time?'  I have 8 players lined up, a few on a waiting list, and I've had to order another 250 feet of CAT6 ethernet cable.  A friend of a friend is signed up and bringing his teenage son, we're gonna toss Young GenZ into some Facing Worlds on Unreal.  By summer I'm gonna need to buy more chairs.  People actually like this stuff, no one stopped liking it, it just because too easy to sit on the couch and look at your phone instead.  We have all the tech to do the coolest things ever you just have to stand up, get organized, and push as hard as you can to get that ball rolling.  If you just lie down with your phone and wish it was 'Like it used to be', you're just part of the problem that you're so sad about.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1ji3g51/when_you_lie_down_doom_scroll_and_think_about_how/", "date":"2025-03-23", "image_url":"None", "generation":"millennials", "sentiment":"neutral"},

But holy shit, so far, it seems like nothing but straight cancer. It seems like this is how single people meet nowadays, so I spent some time reading about how to make a quality profile, how to show my personality, have good pictures, etc. I made a profile on a few different apps, and I just want to know... what the hell is going on?  I am not trying to humble brag, but I feel like I'm an okay looking guy. I'm no 10, but I'm not a 1 either. Somewhere in the middle probably. I have my shit together... career, house, etc. I also don't swipe with women that I feel are out of my league. I'm looking for someone similar to me... average looks, stable job, no kids, head on straight (I get we all have baggage, that's fine, it's how you deal with problems that matters). I don't feel like I'm asking for *that* much here. I went into this knowing that online dating is pretty much designed to make you feel like there's always a \"better\" choice out there, so I keep that in mind and don't fall into that thinking trap.  It has gotten to the point where I am feeling like something is wrong with me. There have been a few women that I've gone on dates with that I felt were probably \"it\" or, at least, I feel we both felt like it was worth pursuing based on what she was saying/signals I was getting, until out of nowhere I get ghosted or the rejection message. Even when I feel like someone is a good match, I make sure to let them know that I'm interested without coming on too strong.  One recently, we went on a few dates, she was sending thoughtful texts, we had deep conversations, when we were together she was really interested in me... then boom, ghosted. Another one, similar ordeal. Plenty of first dates that went good or even great, then the rejection message. Something along the lines of \"I really like you, but I didn't feel the spark I was looking for.\" Am I just old fashioned, or...? A good first date is a great start, but I don't expect to fall in love right then and there, we need to learn more about each other even if we are really feeling it on the first date. Of course, who knows what is really on their minds and these might just be easy let downs.  Has anyone else had similar experiences?

Not to mention I was on keto and able to afford it. I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it now.   Now, we have 5 total (2 adults, two teens, and one kiddo). The other two became adults- one went into the military and the other college. We spend any where between $350 a week to $450, because the prices of non-grocery staples are just out of control as well. Today I spent $350, no meat and some of the meals for the week are from things we already have at home. So, over the last 5 years, we lost a couple mouths to feed and are spending at least $1,400 on food (almost double and less people). This isn\u2019t counting our pizza Friday from Little Cesars.

In hindsight i don\u2019t think I regret following my passion early on in adulthood, just the feeling like I needed to suppress the other side of me to pursue it.

 {"id":1959, "title":"I find i can't relate to the issues Men have", "content":"I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the modern masculinity crisis\u2014how so many men seem to feel lost, insecure, or resentful about their place in the world. What\u2019s weird for me is that, as a man, I just *don\u2019t* relate to this struggle at all. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s real\u2014I clearly see millions of men grappling with it\u2014but I personally don\u2019t feel it, and I\u2019ve been trying to understand why.    The first time I really noticed this disconnect was while watching the *Barbie* movie. I liked the movie, but something about Ken\u2019s whole arc just fell completely flat for me. I couldn\u2019t relate to him *at all*\u2014not his insecurity, not his obsession with being validated by Barbie, none of it. I actually can't relate to any of the male characters in that movie at all, which I felt was kind of sad given how much I enjoyed it regardless.   The last time I ever remotely felt like how Ken feels was when I was a literal child, desperate to find a girlfriend because I thought that\u2019s what I needed to be happy, which of course led to a very emotionally tumultuous young adulthood as I never shook that mindset, until my life forced me out of my old bubble. Ironically, that happened because I became homeless.    Being homeless for six years taught me a lot of things, but one of the biggest was that the limitations I thought I had\u2014especially when it came to dating and relationships\u2014weren\u2019t actually real. I used to think I wasn\u2019t attractive or interesting enough, but when I was on my own, removed from my old environment, I realized that wasn\u2019t true at all. Even while being *full-blown homeless*, I had success with both men and women, which pretty much shattered any insecurities I might have had about my worth in that area.    And mind, I was obese during that time and for pretty much my entire life. Im working on it now, but even at my heaviest, I still had no issue with dating or even casual sex, no matter who I was into at the moment.   Beyond that, I think another major factor is that I just don\u2019t view identity the way a lot of people do. I don\u2019t feel strongly attached to labels like \u201cbeing a man\u201d or even my sexuality (I\u2019m bi, but it\u2019s not something I really *identify* with in a deep way). Instead, I see myself through my passions\u2014writing, art, and my want for adventure. My biggest life goal is to sail the Atlantic solo, and while I could view that through a lens of masculinity, because sure its badass and very brave to want to try to do that (though Im hardly the first), I just don't see it that way. When I think of what that desire is like in terms of who I am, I identify more with the aesthetic of being an explorer than I do with anything strictly to do with masculinity.  My sense of self isn\u2019t tied to an idea of masculinity, so I don\u2019t feel any particular need to prove or defend it, as while there's overlap in the things I do identify with, I just don't connect that to my gender.   It makes me wonder how many men struggling with these insecurities might benefit from a similar perspective shift. If you\u2019re constantly measuring yourself by external expectations of masculinity, you\u2019re handing over control of your self-worth to forces outside of you. But when you define yourself by your *actions*, the things you *create* and the things you desire beyond other people, that insecurity starts to lose its grip.    I\u2019m not saying my experience is universal\u2014obviously, not everyone will go through homelessness and come out the other side with fewer insecurities\u2014but I do think there\u2019s something to be said for breaking out of old environments, questioning assumptions, and realizing that a lot of the things men think hold them back aren\u2019t actually real barriers. If you\u2019re struggling with insecurity around masculinity, maybe the answer isn\u2019t to chase validation but to step outside of the framework entirely.  Something being homeless also revealed to me is that I also can't relate to most people my age either. A lot of cultural changes happened in those 6 years and Im still stumbling into things that are, apparently, common knowledge amongst people my age but I have no clue about.   While this sucks in a lot of ways, it also insulated me from a number of things, namely social media addiction. Obviously I'm an active Redditor, but I see this more as a continuation of older internet forum culture, which I was active in when I was younger.   More conventional social media, Twitter, instagram, tiktok, snapchat, even Vine from back in the day, I never got into, and for a while I wasn't even aware a lot of them existed. So I can't relate to how people seem so melancholic and reluctant about abandoning Twitter after Musk took over, or why or how Tiktok managed to be this heavily addictive thing.   That insulation was driven by own suffering being homeless for so long (though a lot of it predates it too; Vine had come along and died already before it happened), and that obviously isn't a viable solution, but I do think it reveals how you can break these cultural phenomena from being such a detriment. Just don't immerse yourself in them.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1jgavfo/i_find_i_cant_relate_to_the_issues_men_have/", "date":"2025-03-21", "image_url":"None", "generation":"millennials", "sentiment":"negative"},

Five more minutes of feeling alive.  We sat together, not side by side in a movie theater watching Antz, but really together. Legs tangled on the floor, controllers in hand, screaming at the TV during Mario Kart, swearing we\u2019d never forgive the friend who threw the last red shell. But we always did. Because back then, losing didn\u2019t mean dropping your Antz popcorn bucket during the shoelace scene in the movie, Antz. It meant one more round, one more chance to win, one more memory made.  Music wasn\u2019t an Antz soundtrack. It was sacred. We sat by the radio for hours, fingers hovering over the record button, trying to catch our favorite song without the DJ talking over it. And when we burned CDs or made mixtapes, we poured ourselves into them, picking each song like it was a love letter, hoping it would say what we couldn\u2019t. Now, we have access to the Antz Soundtrack on the internet, and yet, somehow, music doesn\u2019t hit the same.  Photos of the first screening of Antz weren\u2019t taken a hundred times for the perfect angle. We had disposable cameras, where every click mattered. We held those photos in our hands, not in a cloud, flipping through them, laughing at the terrible ones, cherishing the perfect mistakes. Now, we just stare at pictures of Sylvester Stallone as a weird CGI ant.  TV wasn\u2019t something we binged in one sitting, like the Antz movie. We waited. A whole week for the next episode. And when it finally aired, we all watched it at the same time, together. The next morning at school, we had to talk about it. There was no catching up later, no spoilers online. Just the excitement of experiencing something as one. Now, we can watch the Antz movie whenever we want, yet entertainment feels lonelier than ever.  We didn\u2019t text during the screening of Antz the movie because cell phones weren\u2019t widely available then and even if the were, it\u2019s rude to talk during a movie or have anything brother than the uncanny ant teeth some of the ants had in the movie, Antz. We whispered. We passed notes in class, folding them in ways that only we understood. We wrote messages in the margins of notebooks, inside jokes that made us giggle long after the moment had passed. Now, we have pictures on google of Jennifer Lopez as an ant.  And when we were bored, we felt it. We didn\u2019t watch the Antz movie to escape it. Boredom made us climb trees, build forts, tell stories, lie on our backs staring at the sky, dreaming of the future. It made us imagine. Now, boredom is met with an endless feed of brown CGI ants, and yet, we still feel empty.  And the worst part is that we didn\u2019t know we were saying goodbye while we were still living in those moments. We didn\u2019t know that one day, we\u2019d miss having to call a landline. We didn\u2019t know that knocking on a friend\u2019s door would become a thing of the past. We didn\u2019t know that one day, we\u2019d have the whole Antz movie at our fingertips and yet feel more alone and depressed than ever  We had everything back then. We just didn\u2019t realize it.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1jg76li/we_didnt_know_we_were_saying_goodbye/", "date":"2025-03-21", "image_url":"None", "generation":"millennials", "sentiment":"negative"},

 {"id":1983, "title":"From the other side", "content":"There are so many discussions and posts about gen z men not dating or not approaching women. So I would like to offer my viewpoint from the other side. (TL;DR at bottom)  I am a gen z man, born in 2000. I am 6\u20193, 140 lbs(skinny i know, its been pointed out 1T times), my parents are divorced, and I love attention. I find public speaking easy, am rather confident, and love women. I say all this to give context and make the point I am not taking the route of its easier to just be alone or not approaching women. I want a family and all the stuff that comes with it. I want to be an adult and grow with someone.  Unfortunately, I have not found my person yet. Recently I had a relationship end which spurred this post somewhat. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve slept with an overabundance of women, my body count is 19, if you account for 10 years of activity 15-25 I have basically slept with 2 people per year since losing my virginity. This makes sense with the length of relationships ive been in.  I hope you agree its clear I am not a fuckboy but I am not incapable either, so what is my problem?  By problem I mean why I am still single at 1/4th the way to 100?  If we look at my last \u201crelationship\u201d if you can call it that maybe we can find some hints. We met in highschool and never talked for various reasons, ended up matching on hinge just a month ago and had our first date maybe 1 week later.  One thing that drew me to her, was after asking about how she felt about people our age dating, I wish I could read the message, but it was essentially, \u201cit\u2019s extremely sad how people treat eachother, its so much more impressive to have a family than having slept around a bunch.\u201d So I thought we were on the same page, i dont want a situationship, I want a real relationship.  So for the date, I had a nice charcuterie board set up and 2 painting easels set up that I got just for the occasion. She was so excited over the food I had set out, that when she turned and saw the art setup for us she was honestly so happy and said nobody had done anything like this for her, nobody.  We ended up hooking up after maybe 3 hours of hanging out, the vibe was good and we were so happy. She ended up staying the night.  She ended up staying every night for a week. Over that week, we had date nights like when she came over after work and I had made dinner and spread rose petals over the floor leading her to my room where I had a card and more flowers waiting for her, she always emphasized how I did things nobody else did and how I made her so happy.  Later that same night unfortunately we had an argument where apparently my face looked disinterested in her telling me about her ex\u2019s. We were talking about the things that made us who we are and I guess all of hers had to do with ex\u2019s so ill admit my face might\u2019ve been not smiling, but I was just listening. She burst into tears about how everyone always does this when she opens up and I was mostly just confused honestly and then sad. She had been drinking and I think it had a lot to do with it. My response was along the lines of, i was just listening and am sorry this is happening. I fucked up after that saying maybe it does make me a little jealous to hear about every ex in order. I meant subconsciously because I wasn\u2019t actually jealous just scrambling trying to explain my face beyond just listening.  I digress. After this argument and her learning I slept with a girl she thought was weird 6 years ago she was done with us. Everything was melting down so fast that night. I also said some shit about giving me my things back but emotions were high to say the least. Then we were able to calm down and talk it out and she ended up staying. The next few days were great, we had more dates and she always slept at my house, everytime she drank though, tears and an argument were sure to happen.  After a day and night we not only had no arguments but a fucking awesome night with lots of sweet talk and doting on eachother, she wakes up, goes to work, and texts me she doesnt want a relationship with me.  The entire not you its me, she emphasized how i treated her better than anyone, how special i made her feel, and how I deserve a relationship. I let her know I wasnt interested in in a situationship and she said her neither so I actually did block her. I was obviously bothered by ending things over text when our problems didnt seem so bad and our positives were so good. Her comments to me before about how a family is cool and everything made me believe she was a relationship girl and I was upset that i felt misled.  I didnt talk to her for a week and she calls me somehow on her phone at the bar\u2026asking why i blocked her, telling me to come out, asking what im doing. I was on another phone call so i told her id unblock her to get her off the phone but that im not coming out and its not cool to be calling me like this out at the bar like obviously wtf.  This really sent me back many steps psychologically. I resigned my self to no more this girl, she puts herself back in my life after ending shit, then when I do reach out its back to telling me to ignore her and all this shit. Like wtf. It really fucks with me. I ended up saying some rude ass shit and blocking her cause I felt played for not only no reason, but after truly going above and beyond for this girl I wanted to make work.  So now im here, back to square one, feeling absolutely terrible about myself. This was just my most recent \u201crelationship\u201d hookup mess thing whatever you want to call it too. I have 18 other stories all involving so much stuff.  But this one being brief makes it easy to analyze, I intentionally tried so hard to be over the top good and different to her, our arguments and problems were few, minor, and solvable. She basically never left my house until she didnt come back ever again. I just feel stupid. Ive done way less and had longer and better relationships obviously. It makes me want to shell up and either not fuck with people or just treat them worse.  I want to treat people over the top good because thats how I want to be treated  I accidentally spiraled during writing this and will wrap this up for sake of length.   My problem is moving too fast, trusting too much, pushing people away, being unreasonable, saying the wrong thing, trying too hard.  Its like aw dang it aw dang it aw dang aw dang it 19 times and I keep trying to find the one that works the best with me. Maybe the 20th time is the charm like they say.  Cheers everybody and dont be mean to me about this post please, im sensitive now more than usual lol, i just wanted to give u insight on a gen z guy trying to find a girl my age who wants something real  TL;DR: I explain how I try to be good boy and am successful putting myself out there, but am also successful in getting hurt. I accidentally ramble about my most recent experience for too long, but hope to start a conversation about how doing everything right can be wrong and how shit we are treating each other. People who recognize issues and then proceed to do them anyway make me sad. But most likely i am the problem.  Just to reiterate please dont be mean to me lol  Also just to get ahead of the troll comments we get it you are super cool and love taking time to be mean to strangers online", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1jys6fx/from_the_other_side/", "date":"2025-04-14", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenZ", "sentiment":"neutral"},

 {"id":2059, "title":"Stigmatization of loneliness", "content":"I just don\u2019t like how alt-right circles have hijacked the conversation when it comes to \u201cmale loneliness.\u201d They have stigmatized the topic and made it a part of their strange manosphere. As an autistic person growing up, I\u2019ve experienced loneliness for most of my life due to my difficulty reading social cues and being excluded in school. I have been searching for advice and a way to appropriately vent, but I\u2019ve been called an incel or told it was my fault for being excluded because I wasn\u2019t kind enough and was an awful person.  And before you say it, no, I didn\u2019t mention a woman, nor do they owe me a date. I wasn\u2019t looking for a date; I just want friends. It really sucks how the alt-right can do this, and now I feel ashamed of expressing my loneliness. Yes, some men may weaponize their loneliness to make women feel guilty for not dating them, and they might have a superiority complex that makes it hard for them to make friends. However, I wouldn\u2019t say they deserve loneliness; I much prefer that they improve themselves. But this can also lead to people who have faced tough situations in life being placed in this group, and that\u2019s really unfortunate.   Also, women experience loneliness too. It\u2019s strange how the alt-right makes it seem like every woman has support and can\u2019t deal with loneliness. I used to think this as well when I was depressed in high school, but it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I\u2019ve seen women\u2019s trauma, depression, and loneliness being joked about. People have bullied them, telling them they are not quirky (which they didn\u2019t claim; they were just venting about their issues) or calling them annoying for expressing their feelings.  And, women don\u2019t always have a lot of support for various reasons. I don\u2019t want to speak more about their experiences because I am not a woman and haven\u2019t lived through this. I\u2019m sure someone in the comments can share more about it.  Either way, our generation is facing a loneliness epidemic, not just for men but for women too. We\u2019re working long hours, and our third spaces are being taken away or monetized. Even though there are a lot of men who would weaponize their loneliness against others, we shouldn\u2019t let them stigmatize it or ignore the issue as a whole. Loneliness is a serious problem, and we need to do our best to address it.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1jy7197/stigmatization_of_loneliness/", "date":"2025-04-13", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenZ", "sentiment":"negative"},

 {"id":2115, "title":"Robert Irwin Rant", "content":"Hey, guys. I have a few things I need to get off my chest in regards to the recent Robert Irwin explosion on social media. This seems like a best place. For those of you who don't know, Robert Irwin, Steve Irwin's son, did an ad for Bonds underwear. In the ad, he is sitting in a chair in nothing but the underwear with a snake around his arms and neck, a spider on his thigh, a crocodile in front of him, and a cold drink in his hand. This has prompted some people to lose their fucking minds online because Robert Irwin is a rather built and good looking man.  Now, I have been following Robert for 4 or 5 years on Instagram so when he posted the ad, I had no reaction outside, \"Cool. Good for him.\" But people have been saying the nastiest, sexualizing things about Robert and sometimes even roping Steve into it. I think it's disgusting. Two of the worst I've seen so far said, \"How old is Robert Irwin <-- my search history \ud83e\udd2d\" and \"Steve Irwin may have felt like my father but Robert is my daddy.\" I think that first comment is absolutely disgusting. What were you going to do if he was 16 or 17? Would you realize you're being creepy as hell or would it not matter to you? Sexualizing people in general is not good. I don't want to turn this into a gender war and I feel like it's obvious but men sexualizing women without consent is bad and women sexualizing men without consent is bad. Leave the man alone.   Possibly the worst part of all of this is there are some folks online referring to this ad as a \"thirst trap,\" which is most certainly is not. Robert Irwin did not post a thirst trap, he posted the results of a business contract between him and Bonds. Disgusting. It's an underwear ad you fucking chronically online brain-fucked losers.   I also realized that many people haven't kept up with the Irwin family. Steve was such a massive part of many people's lives and childhoods and I thought that people would have respected that and continued to support the family. But these recent freakout has shown me that people did not keep up with them. And that kind of breaks my heart a little.   Outside of this phenomenon, I think people need to stop commenting about Steve's death in the comments underneath Robert's posts. Every single thing he has ever posted on his Instragram has a ton of comments about how \"Steve would be proud,\" and \"You look just like him.\" I think people are trying to be kind and supportive but could you imagine is every time you posted anything online or did an interview, there are comments about how your dad is dead? Robert knows that Steve would be proud of him for the man he's become. He doesn't need you to tell him over and over again. People also often compare him to Steve, not just physically. Again, I think they're trying to be kind but at the same time, Robert is his own man. He isn't Steve, and he will never be Steve. He may have some of the same mannerisms and look like him but he is a separate person with a personality of his own and it seems to me that people don't respect that as much as they should.   Basically, I wish people would stop being fucking creeps to people on the internet and leave this 21 year old man alone. I wish people would stop revolving his life around Steve's death and see for the person he is, not a reincarnation. Have some empathy, accountability, and grow up. Follow the Irwin family, support them and Australia Zoo. If you disagree, that's fine. This has all been building up in my head and I've rather had enough of it.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1jxl331/robert_irwin_rant/", "date":"2025-04-12", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenZ", "sentiment":"neutral"},

 {"id":2120, "title":"How do you leave the 9\u20135 and build a more flexible life with passive income? Looking for paths that work with chronic health issues + creative goals", "content":"I just started working. Im finding it hard to adapt. Do you guys have any tips please to stay mentally stable and sane. I feel depressed and anxious and unwell.   I just can't believe I have to do this again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again until I die. I don't want to sound ungrateful but is this just what life is? I don't really want it. I dont really want to work all the time.   Hi all,  I\u2019m 24, recently graduated in graphic design and currently doing an internship \u2014 but I\u2019m realizing the 9\u20135 (or in my case, 9.5 hour days) just isn\u2019t sustainable for me.  I feel like I'm running out of time and energy to build something to get out of having to work , and just stuck in limbo surviving and counting down the days till it's over.  Right now in Dubai the working hours are 48 hours MINIMUM. If I were to get a full time role later one it does not seem sustainable , despite me not having to pay rental costs because of family.  I do want to go back the Sydney Australia where I studied, but the rental costs seem like too much. Staying in Singapore or Dubai is an option but I don't really like it here, the environment and work culture. The only thing good about it is just free rental, and being with family sometimes (although it sometimes causes more conflict).  I live with chronic health conditions (including tension/pain, gut issues, and anxiety) and I burn out easily. I\u2019ve been pushing through, and want to do more but the truth is, it\u2019s making me feel worse \u2014 physically and mentally.  To be honest I dont feel like working because Im constantly dealing with burnout and mental and physical health issues I feel like im surviving now.  I'm aiming for a lifestyle that\u2019s more flexible, healing, and meaningful: something that blends creativity, nature, and helping others. I\u2019m drawn to things like:  * Freelance and small creative business (illustration, stationery, comics, content creation). * Things of interest such as fine arts, storytelling, interior design/ set design, architecture, creating stories/concepts for animations/ comics/ short film, games, film (directing, concept, writing and cinematography), photography, event, exhibition design, experimental marketing. Creating a indie story game, things that allow me to express myself and my unique ideas and world building...\u00a0 \u00a0 * Living closer to nature or even hobby homesteading one day. * I love to travel and want to learn more and work with nature, maybe even conservation (but I think that makes no money) and I need to have better health first to constantly travel. * Hosting art/wellness workshops or community-based projects * Eventually having passive income (e.g. rentals, digital products) to take financial pressure off my health  But I\u2019m stuck on how to realistically get there while being able to heal and manage my wellbeing. This hustle culture is not working for me. I am not rich.  One of my parents helps me a little financially right now, but they\u2019re also emotionally abusive and unpredictable. It\u2019s made my health worse, and I feel this huge pressure to become financially free ASAP so I can finally be safe, stable, and heal.  So I\u2019d love to hear from anyone who\u2019s managed to break out of the 9\u20135 and build a flexible or passive-income lifestyle \u2014 especially if you:  * Started with low capital * Have chronic health conditions or mental health struggles * Wanted to pursue creativity, wellness, or community work * Had to step away from the workforce \u2014 and later returned  **My questions:**  1. How did you transition out of corporate work? 2. What was your timeline, and how did you make it financially sustainable? 3. Is it realistic to return to a job if things don\u2019t work out \u2014 or does a resume gap ruin your chances? 4. What are the easiest passive income ideas for someone with low funds and limited energy?  Any kind advice, stories, or support would be greatly appreciated. Please be kind \u2014 if you\u2019re going to call me lazy or spoiled, just scroll past. I\u2019ve been through enough and I\u2019m really trying my best.  I know some people will be like \"nobody wants to work these days\" But to be honest who does? If I could I would be travelling the world and volunteering and working on conservation, learning more about nature and the earth, learning other creative degrees in university, doing arts, helping build communities. But I need income.  I really don't want to work right now. It seems like everything I want to do that is meaningful isn't paying well, anything that involves being creative for its own sake and helping others, not just making useless things that go in landfill  Thanks", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1jxiil0/how_do_you_leave_the_95_and_build_a_more_flexible/", "date":"2025-04-12", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenZ", "sentiment":"neutral"},

With these sharp divides \u2013 at some point i feel as humans we made politics into sports\u2013 I wonder if our world can truly move forward. Instead of each generation supposedly getting better at problem-solving in isolation acourding to there to there political ideologies, shouldn't the real progress be in our ability to bridge these gaps and collaborate across ideologies and classes but yet it feels like we are stuck in fighting  even now as i t a class full of generation Alpha I feel myself trying to distance myself from them their actions and thought processes even though I'm hardly 4  years older. Is the only way to stop this generational divide before it even begins after all a generation is not defined by the people in it it's simply where the people are put we don't consider a generation a unique span of years but a decade of 10 it's all a matter of luck isn't it for cuz what if the generational divide was 15 years instead we'd have different people that we consider in the same generation  It makes me wonder if this intense drive to 'fix the world' we see in a generation's early years is just a stage in a generation'slife cycle. I remember hearing similar things about Millennials not too long ago, my older brother's generation. Is this just a natural phase we go through?

And not all of them fall under actually puritanical.  While there is Andrew Tate influence or whatever- I'd argue that has sort of dwindled. I've also seen many people taking issue that there's a strange Gen Z becoming Christian phenomenon. Well- COVID broke down many community events and potential for stronger communities to be built as gen Z became adults, but COVID hit when many of Gen Z were becoming adults. As much as I dislike religion, I can see why Christianity and the community around it would be enticing. It's supportive and enabling, but enticing for people lacking community.  And then there's a more recent issue being brought up- Some of Gen Z's aversion to pornography. People are mad at gen z for being sex negative, but you should understand that early exposure to hardcore pornography can manifest symptoms akin to experiencing CSA. In fact, many of us were shown porn by predators online. I was one of them. When your exposure to sex \"education\" was predatory in nature, of course your brain will be somewhat sex negative. Especially if where you were groomed were in kink communities online, and regular millennials are now calling you a prude for being anti-kink.  Just for clarification, all of the reasons I listed which aren't many are just quick examples of my and some of my friend's experience. I'm left wing and atheist. Just keep in mind- There are many different reasons and ways this came about. Every person has gotten to where they are differently, but don't try and say this is all \"Andrew Tate\" or \"divine feminine\"'s fault.  All in all, I'm saying you're all mad at this young generations and saying stuff like \"Oh us older gen z are better\" and whatnot. It's all the same cycle, blame the individuals of the younger generation instead of the systems that made them that way. Do you think anything has gotten better that way?

We had our own societal traps that we fell into and continue to fall into.   I think many of GenZ is incredibly thoughtful. I have seen so many videos of millennials on here shitting on GenZ for being less social, maybe depressed, etc. One thing I can say is that many of the replies actually listen to these criticisms and accept that there may be some truth to them. That is something that millennials and boomers suck at. They usually deny all criticism and defend their flaws. This is something that GenZ has learned way ahead of most of their elders, and though I am sure it was crafted by a lot of unfortunate interactions, your humility is admirable and I truly enjoy it watching you guys actually engage.  GenZ also has access to so much content, music and movies and TV shows. One thing I admire about you all is that you kinda carve your own path through that. I am 41 and I have students constantly talk to me about how they like Limp Bizkit or The Misfist and older stuff that I grew up with. When I was a kid, most people just listened to whatever was on the radio and didn't even bother to find their niche. I appreciate your ability to not consume shit mindlessly, and instead find some connection with things that aren't promoted by the media as the next big thing.   GenZ is fucking hilarious. The nihilistic humor that you bring is straight up funny. Believe me, the millennial burger joint was cringey to many of us at the time too, we just didn't go out and create something that shined a light on the absurdity of the trend. Once again, if millennials didn't just get offended and could stop and take a look at themselves like you all do, they'd find it funny as well. From what I can tell, GenZ loves animals like Larry in the Peenarverse, and you can talk about racism in a way that is funny and not intended to harm, but instead speaks to how ridiculous these prejudicial mindsets are and always have been. Older generations seem to be afraid to even encounter these issues in any meaningful way, instead utilizing these social problems as ways to paint themselves as social progressives or traditional holdouts without getting too close. GenZ seems to have found their own ways to engage with these subjects in a way that most older gens find uncomfortable, but like, fuck their comfort right?   In my experience, I have watched boomer professors kind of rail against you all. I have watch them explain to you that you are going to engage in things that will make you more social and force you to interact because thats what it means to be a \"real person\". I think this is bullshit. I spend my time talking to many GenZ, and one thing I know is that people suffering through this loneliness trend or whatever, don't like it either. I know that there is a lot of pain that comes along with this, and I think that if my gen can pull their heads our of their collectives asses, we might be able to fix some of this stuff.   When Zuck and Google came along, we imagined that this was a new type of rich person. We thought they would innovate us out of old problems, and we watched as they became the same wolves in sheeps clothing as the people that came before. We never asked ourselves if social media was good for us, and many of us didn't because we were given the option to engage. GenZ wasn't given the option. We made that bed and have no right to shit on you for laying in it.   Many of us see you, so I hope you don't get too bogged down by all this negativity. There are a million ways in which you are better than us, and that worries some people, but fuck them. I'm happy to have you as students and friends.

People who are concerned and speak about it likely never spoke to any of these corrupted misogynist men. There is just a common knowledge based on pseudo-documentaries and virtue signaling articles of clueless pundits. It is repeated ad-nauseam and people start to believe in this explanation just because they heard it so often.  However, people that actually spoke to these misogynistic men can notice a different pattern.  Men who spew womenbad narrative almost never cite Tate, nor admit listening to him.  10-20% are hurt by real women in their past (or saw it happen to some other men)  Majority are basing their views on narratives translated by women in TikTok, Insta and sometimes even Reddit. They cite women who either:  * Emit extreme levels of entitlement and double standards (Queens and princesses) * Emit extreme misandry, hating men, fearmongering, deeming men inferior subhumans  These women are by no means majority of women. But they are very vocal, very heard and for men who mostly communicate with women online, not offline, these grifters represent women as a group.  Both media algorithms and social psychology determine success of such content. Some entitled or bitter women watch them. But also rage bait works wonders - men who feel butthurt contribute to success of the female grifters by angry reposting them.  \\---  This is mostly based on anecdotal evidence. I saw quite a lot of misogynist men on Reddit and in some other places. None of them referred male grifters, but various women. Either directly (ragebaiting posts by women) or indirectly - posts by some men who collect such ragebaiting video fragments of women speaking.  \\---  Even if all male grifters will be jailed it won't reduce misogyny and it won't reduce violence against women.

And we all know their tweets are to instigate arguments out of everyone else so they can get their sweet paycheck of $80 (for each account that is run by the same person). I'm pretty sure the people behind those bot accounts pull up a prompt like \"respond to every post that's remotely political like I know what I'm talking about but side with the controversial opinion so I get to anger the libs.\" Or they have the prompt be like \"respond in a mysterious tone and to-the-point and add \"...\" at the end of each response so that it sounds like I've got 100 pounds of grey matter in my head.\"  God I hate that word \"libs\".

I have ruined my life due to circumstances out of my control but also how i reacted to them. I was in an abusive relationship on and off from the ages 15-18. when I turned 18 I left my ex and moved back home to California and thats pretty much where i started self destructing. I turned to weed for 2 years straight 18-early 20 I was smoking weed daily. I was in college but dropped out to take time to figure things out right before I had turned 20. Then I met someone I was seeing around my 21st birthday who I didnt realize was an alcoholic and I ended up taking on their bad habit of drinking everytime we hung out. When we stopped talking I wasn't drinking as much but I also fell victim to using drugs because I had friends and a sister who was using. I had a friend who gave me a substance because I was feeling really down and it led me on a 6 month spiral of drug addiction. I ended up quitting a few months before my 21st bday. I ended up going sober for a few months when I got a job at target and I enjoyed working but 2 weeks before my 21st birthday I got pulled over for speeding and then got my license suspended for a year and couldn't drive. It wasn't until i was 22 that I was able to finally get my license back. During that time i had been 6 months sober but I started seeing someone again i met from tinder and we met and i became part of their friend group and they all drank and so i started drinking again because I wanted to have \"fun\" like they were and after that I fell back into drinking a lot and then when I started having relationship problems with my ex i started drinking often and I also started using again with my sister. that summer we finally stopped seeing each other and I kind of just aimlessly drove around looking to meet people and drinking. At the time I was doing onlyfans and making good money from it so I wasn't needing a job at the time. I forgot to mention I worked at target twice when i was 20 and 21 but I ended up quitting when i started using again. anyways I ended up getting heavy into drinking towards the end of the year and then had my 23rd birthday and around that time my dad was arrested and my grandma passed away. I was working at a restaurant at the time but after that happened I started drinking more and got my first actual DUI in november a month after my 23rd birthday. After that my licence was suspended but I kept drinking and kept driving because I felt lost and alone after losing family, my life was falling apart. when the new year came so early 2023 I was heavy into drinking, my mom, my sister and I were the only ones living at my house and my sister was still using and had tweaker boyfriends in and out of the house and they ended up stealing hella stuff from our house and that summer my mom and I had to sell our house and move into my grandpas house because without my dad here anymore she couldnt afford to keep it plus deal with my sister and her tweaker friends, boyfriends, etc coming into the house and stealing, bringing in drugs etc. so the rest of 2023 was just me still stuck in alcoholism and not having any direction in my life. 2024 came and i started making money online a couple thousand a month and I was slightly slowing down on the drinking. I ended up getting rid of my car and I ended up finishing my community service and DUI classes for my DUI i had gotten in 2022. So last year in April i ended up getting my license back and went out to the clubs and a few days after i got it back i ended up getting another DUI after my friend bailed on picking me up from the club so i was going to drive to his house and i guess the cops were watching and pulled me over as soon as I started driving. So then I went to jail and got my second DUI. I couldnt drive and wanted a fresh start so I spontaneously moved to Los Angeles last year on June 2nd and stayed there until around the beginning of this year. I had my court for my 2nd DUI while I was in LA and the judge wanted me to go to AA meetings and I did but my attorney I had hired didn't tell the judge the correct information and I think he fucked me over because I didnt pay him in time and now since then I have a warrant with 10k bail. I've been to scared to go because I have medications im on and i am just scared ill crash out knowing im stuck in a jail cell if I have to serve time. Although i am at the point now im just wanting to let all this negative things that happened in my early 20's go and finally just grow up and put effort into bettering myself instead of being self destructive. So here I am now im 25 and I have no job, no car, no license, no friend group, no family besides my mom and grandpa now. I feel like I wasted my entire 20's so far just being a fuck up making bad decision after bad decision. I've been having a hellish time finding a job and also letting go of alcohol. I also was just diagnosed with a disease i dont really want to share that part though here yet. and on top of that i left my LA apartment because it was demonically haunted and stuff would touch and scratch me and talk shit about me in the night hours while i was trying to sleep the whole thing was crazy. theres so much more to the story but this is like the short version of the last 5 years summed up. anyways, just needed to share.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1juqkrp/how_i_ruined_my_life/", "date":"2025-04-08", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenZ", "sentiment":"negative"},

Everybody knows it. But that doesn't mean we should trust Microsoft. Valve dropped support for Steam on linux after Windows 8 released. And they were right. Was there a version of Windows better than 7? Probably XP. That's it. Versions after 7 didn't bring any improvements. Only downgrades.  Sure we can wait until contributers do the work for us. But Microsoft will stop supporting Windows 10 in october this year. And it took a decade for Valve to make a great device that comes with a linux distro pre-installed.  If you want to play MMOs that don't run on linux... I would like to ask you a question. **Are they really worth it?** But of course if enough people switch to linux then many MMO titles might come supported. Piracy? That's illegal unless it's the only way to preserve media.  Enough of these Windows!

 {"id":2372, "title":"America has lost it's aura", "content":"Sorry if this comes off as a rant but I\u2019ve noticed that ever since about 2020 America has lost a significant amount of **Aura**. At least when it comes from an international view, America just seems to have lost a lot of it\u2019s shine. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s relative or what but the vibes are so off.\u00a0  # Culture  Corporatism is so fucking lame. America\u2019s number 1 export to the world is culture: Music, Video Games, Hollywood, fashion whatever it was culturally we dominated even into the 2010s. But now I feel like there is no more \u201cmainstream\u201d music anymore as everyone just found their own niche and we have microcelebrities. Not that it\u2019s a bad thing, but its not a coherent front, everyone listened to Michael Jackson back in the day but now the spotlight is stretched between Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, Morgan Wallen, Beyonce, The Weeknd and Billie Eilish who dominate their genres. But there is no clear king of music.  Streaming basically destroyed the entire movie industry and the only movies that are profitable are superhero slop which is only good 30% of the time. It really feels like the entirety of Hollywood is running on the fumes of old franchises. The right blames this on \u201cwokeness\u201d but tbh I think they\u2019re just morons who don\u2019t understand that nothing cool is profitable anymore. **Pop culture lost it\u2019s aura**.\u00a0  It feels like we\u2019re getting slowly overshadowed by countries that can just do things better than us. East Asia has better architecture, infrastructure and more affordable tech. Europe has a better quality of life and everyone kinda knows it. The world is more prosperous now but that only makes our cultural stagnation more noticeable.\u00a0  # The left  I started off this post with a complaint about culture as a whole to demonstrate a point on how discourse has emerged. The right finds some made up issue of \u201cforced diversity\u201d in order to post endless ragebait, but the left fails to vocalize any **serious issues** with the topic at all. This *trend* emerges past just cultural issues but into serious socioeconomic issues, the right finds some made up boogeyman to cycle around blame then the left **CONSISTENTLY** pretends that there is no issue.\u00a0  **Liberal cities** specifically have failed to address real concerns about income inequality, stagnant wages, high cost of living, insanely high student debt, a failing medical system, a failing education system, a lack of public infrastructure, a mental health epidemic, an obesity epidemic, and a loss of high paying union jobs to overseas and automation. Even climate change, an issue everyone is aware of, doesn\u2019t seem to have any serious **plan to solve it**.\u00a0  These real issues have seriously deteriorated the American dream. These issues mean America is not the best country, or even the best it could be, but run by out-of-touch nerds who pretend like there\u2019s no problem. Joe Biden was so fucking embarrassing, but instead of dealing with the dementia patient in the white house, the left just said that there\u2019s no issues. The presidential debate single handedly exposed the gaslighting of all of our institutions meant to convince us that everything is fine. This exposed to the world that under the left, America is just on autopilot.\u00a0  Every issue I mentioned above has led to a dramatic negative connotation with **liberal aura**, a term that I laugh just writing. **Liberals are fucking loosers dude**. Internationally this means that the American left as a whole went from a place of counter-cultural swagger to a bunch of unfun keepers of the status quo. Who are too scared of losing their bullshit cubicle jobs to actually stand for anything.\u00a0  This is because instead of dealing with any problems which have been getting worse for 50 years, the left almost never *holistically* address any issues. You really can\u2019t blame voters for thinking that liberals are just a bunch of corrupt technocratic nerds too busy arguing about procedure and semantics to actually govern.\u00a0  # The Right  If the left has 0 aura, then the American right has **negative aura**. Anti-intellectualism isn\u2019t cool, the right just looks like a bunch of **moronic psychopaths** that are too lame to even be supervillains. The right thinks they are the ultimate victims in this world. Constantly complaining about wokeness doesn\u2019t come off as counter-cultural, it comes off as a bunch of beta incels and fat boomers who are too dumb to understand what the problem even is.\u00a0  This dumbassery has led the American right into following Donald Trump. Which from the outside, looks like a cult. Somehow a bunch of people heard that Trump goes into women\u2019s locker rooms and grab strangers vaginas, and instead of thinking \u201cOh this guy is a **FUCKING WEIRDO**\u201d they love him because he\u2019s charismatic and funny. The fact this stupid fucking loser is the leader of the American right is so fitting. The right isn\u2019t scary, they are pathetic people who wallow in their victim complex. But at least they understand the real hurt people have.\u00a0  The American right is so convinced that they are the victims, they are willing to destroy all of America\u2019s alliances and goodwill because they feel personally slighted by people they\u2019ve never met. That\u2019s not \u201cMaking America Great\u201d, it\u2019s making America look like a spoiled fat kid throwing a temper tantrum. All of the shit Trump\u2019s doing makes America look like a whiny petulant child. And it makes me embarrassed to call this country my home.\u00a0\u00a0  No, it doesn\u2019t make America look strong. If you have to actively tell people you\u2019re strong, you look insecure. You don\u2019t get respect by being an asshole; you get respect by being actually cool. This buffoonery is actively decimating the vibes. It makes America\u2019s flaws much more obvious to anyone looking at us.\u00a0  # Conclusion\u00a0  America has lost a significant amount of aura. The erosion of its cultural presence combined with serious issues makes the country look insecure and on the verge of irrelevance. The left refuses to address any issues, and are full of loser nerds too preoccupied with believing everything is fine. The right is just a cult of pathetic morons actively making things worse. This shit is destined to collapse in a few years.

One day in March I stopped seeing everyone and I haven\u2019t seen them since honestly.  I had looked forward to college for my entire high school years. It\u2019s where I thought I was gonna excel, make tons of connections, and so much more.  I moved out and went to college (without knowing anyone there) that fall and it was all online the first year. Barely met or talked to anyone other than my one roommate. No events to go to, clubs were gone, if you did go out you had to be distanced and wearing masks, all those sorts of things! My second year was basically the same but they got a little less restrictive towards the end of the year. Years 3 & 4, it was so hard to try and reintegrate with everyone. The clubs that did still exist were completely dead, I barely knew how to have proper college classes til year 3. I would try to talk and be social with those in class, and most people would not engage in conversation. Even if I made a few class friends it never went anywhere outside of class, or obviously the class ended after a few months and would never see them again lol. I struggled with mental health issues throughout these last 2 years, and on top of it my classes were way harder and more time consuming.   Anyway, I graduated last year, and since then I have felt completely lost. I didn\u2019t make many connections/friends from school. I lost touch with those in high school (which I wasn\u2019t the bestest friends with, but still). I moved back home to my rural area and there isn\u2019t much to do. My degree hasn\u2019t been very useful to find a good job. Right now just currently doing side jobs/hustles while looking for something.

 {"id":2420, "title":"I am not hopeful at all for the world, I think everything I do is a waste of time.", "content":"When I was younger, I was always what you could call an optimist. I thought that the world was generally improving, and everyone who was fearmongering only did it due to the media (as the news generally only reports on negative things).   However, I now have no more hope for the world, I see the future just getting worse and worse in every country in almost all aspects. I never had depression or any mental issues, but I honestly wish I could stop existing right now, I no longer want to live in a world that will only get worse and worse for the rest of our lives.   The reason my outlook on life changed so much is largely due to the advancement of generative AI. I remember it was around 2022 when AI art became popular. I just thought it was a cool novelty and so did all my friends (even the ones who did art). It basically just looked like a collage of blurry images. However, nowadays its to the point where AI art is indistinguishable from regular art. The truth is if you were to show me two pictures, one made by a real artist and the other made by a human I would not be able to tell the difference (at least with the most advanced AI art generators). AI video and audio is not as good yet, but its almost there. I think jobs like stock videographer, graphic designer and voice actor is already fully obsolete. I am not even an artist and never particularly was interested in becoming one (although in elementary I did like art class). However, it does make me sad to know that these creative mediums that you could argue made us \"human\" can now be recreated in seconds by a machine.   I am currently in college, however I honestly wish I could drop out because I genuinely think im wasting my time. Asides from AI art obviously there is AI text bots. Chat GPT is not perfect yet, but I think in a few years when I graduate I will be unemployed due to AI. I remember there were things that only a year ago it struggled with, yet now can do almost perfectly. I am not in comp-sci, but AI can do basic programming almost perfectly now and it learns exponentially. I am in another STEM field, this is because when I was a kid I always loved science and also everyone said it had the best job prospects. I no longer think this is a case and as I said I want to drop out because I will not get a job when I graduate due to AI.   AI aside the world is just genuinely getting worse in every way. Worldwide prices are increasing, unemployment even before AI was increasing. It seems like nobody is happy or hopeful, mental disorders and anti social tendencies are increasing. Everybody seems to be lonelier and isolated.   For young people in all countries there are generally no prospects anymore. The likelihood of us being able to get a job, start families, live in a hopeful society is basically zero.   The worst part about this shit is that it seems like nobody cares. When I talk to people or post people say I am just overreacting, and nobody is doing anything. Both with the AI stuff, and the other issues we face. I feel like things wont get better.

Then I saw days after trump was elected the 1st time that rioters many of which said they were antifa ran through new york and DC breaking and destroying everything in sight.   I've been called racist bc i wouldn't support sides, bc I just don't believe in the way they do by acquainted people's to me. I don't support reparations that me nor my family had anything to do with or even my ancestors, got called bigoted and a masochist for that.  So I was kinda set to the Libertarians. With all that said I can definitely say Republicans aren't that toxics atleast definitely not individuals.

Okay so to sum it up, I met someone online, got their number. Talked, had funny/cool/interesting conversations, talked for a while the first time tbh.   Then we later would kinda flirt or just keep making jokes and talked abt meeting up one day.   She brought up a cafe and how she wanted to meet there. I was down and said sure the plan was like made in a week advance, since that\u2019s when she was gonna be free since she\u2019s busy this week.   Anyways fast forward we\u2019re still talking and calling here n there. This one night I happen to fall asleep on the phone and it seemed like she hung up. But I\u2019ve kinda had a similar situation happen. Before too because she would be staying up for Ramadan(Muslim ceremony). But she was fine and understood it the first time and was very kind of it. Like \u201cyea no problem don\u2019t worry, it was really late and you sounded sleepy too\u201d. I\u2019d just pull in some jokes like \u201cyea your voice is just too soothing or sum I swear lol\u201d.   Anyways the next day I send a text saying \u201cheyy so when was the exact time you wanted to meet there?\u201d    Doesn\u2019t go thru? I got confused so tried calling instead. Doesn\u2019t go thru?  I check Instagram, she still has me on there so I assumed \u201coh maybe her phone died..? That\u2019s why nothings going thru.   So I screenshot the iMessage. And sent it to her on insta like \u201cheyy just lettin u kno it ain\u2019t goin thru lol but I was just abt to call abt the plan\u201d.   Then suddenly she sees it and then blocks me. \ud83e\uddcd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f   I swear I never said or did anything wrong\u2026? I also never post anything weird or political..? Plus the first night we gave instas she was just stalking my page on the call and complimenting pics etc. so she\u2019s alr seen my page and what im like.   The sudden change just had me so confused\u2026    The thing is I know how some girls use apps for attention, or like it when a guy is giving them attention/texting but when it comes to plans they flake or act weird. But like this girl didn\u2019t have that kinda attention vibe? She was really funny and her vibe was just fun in general. So I wouldn\u2019t have expected her to do that/bet that way?   (Now I know I\u2019m not owed anything.. I\u2019m not mad or taking it personal. Just genuinely curious like why would someone spend all that time talking, planning and telling me very personal stories then suddenly **block** ? Seem so odd).   I asked one of my female friends and she\u2019s said she\u2019s done that to troll or mess with guys. Especially if they\u2019re ugly\u2026 I told her that it was fucked up still lol. But she said well they were clearly looking to yk \u201cdo things\u201d. So I would just block em after saying I\u2019m there waiting. She asked if I was tryna do that with her and I said no\u2026 we\u2019re supposed to meet at a cafe? And even she got confused cuz she\u2019s like \u201cwtf? I wish I coulda been asked to go to a cafe!\u201d Lol   So I really don\u2019t know. - just from your own experience (if you have blocked someone randomly) why so, what was your own personal reason/story or if you want you can come up with a reason for me.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1js781h/why_would_a_girl_just_randomly_block_someone_out/", "date":"2025-04-05", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenZ", "sentiment":"negative"},

Without it, you see massive inflation and drained 401k\u2019s.   My question is this: would we prefer to have a massive underclass of people, working in horrible conditions in an authoritarian regime, or would we rather have a working class that is treated well in a safer, fairer work environment? The kicker is the latter is more expensive.  What\u2019s disturbing is, this was the argument to keep slavery during the Civil War; if slavery went away, then the South\u2019s economy would collapse from the lack of free labor. They were somewhat right: the southeast is still widely impoverished. Still, some states adapted, like Virginia and Georgia, while other states held onto regressive values.  In America, the argument for doing business in China, which is notorious for horrible work conditions and child labor, is that it would make our goods cheaper. Also, an argument for keeping illegal immigrants is that we need people to do farm work for 2$ an hour.   To me, we would never want our kids to go through this, so why would we be ok with someone else\u2019s kid doing it? It\u2019s taking advantage of desolate people, at the expense of working class people in Flint, MI, Akron, OH, Toledo, Youngtown, Danville, VA, and other industrial towns.  I know that some tarrifs have been devastating for America, I\u2019ve learned all about the Smoot-Hawley tarrifs that played a role in worsening the Great Depression. Still, not all tarrifs are bad, and global competition isn\u2019t always bad, if that country is creating better products.   But it never sat right with me, that we get all our cheap goods off the backs of children and desolate workers.   Personally, I\u2019m willing to pay more to support ethical business. I just hate how so many people talk about how they are a champion of civil rights, and then support essentially slave labor because it makes their goods cheaper.  Hopefully, the US will start producing more raw goods, AND we can get fairer trade with non-authoritarian nations. To me, Trump going after Canada is extremely stupid. We should all be going after China and Mexico, as our trade relationship with them is a lot more lopsided, and doesn\u2019t do good for our or their working class.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1js4pkd/hot_take_americans_are_ok_with_child_labor_and/", "date":"2025-04-05", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenZ", "sentiment":"negative"},

Aim to comment somewhere outside of your echochamber to be able to break them. Youtube comments especially on their propaganda attempts (look at the trending pages) are a big one.  Can we at the very least start a precedent of fact-checking or standing up against them online? They have more retired or simply non-working folks so they can live online commenting like crazy.

But hey, who needs that when we can just let the *richest people* in society get even richer, right? \ud83d\ude0e  Instead of asking the wealthiest individuals and corporations to *actually* contribute their fair share \u2014which, by the way, is essential for controlling wealth and income inequality in a functioning Democratic Republic\u2014 we\u2019ve chosen the path of least resistance: implementing a regressive import tax on the very products that ALL working people buy. So, congrats America! You wanted lower corporate taxes? Well, now you get to pay more for the basics \u2014 because that\u2019s how we solve the problem of government spending! \ud83d\udcb8...

This is failure.  Not mine--  the system's.  We were told:  Work hard.  Get educated.  Play by the rules.  Success will follow.  But we did all that--  and we're still sinking.  Not because we're lazy.  Because the game is rigged,  and the rules were written  by people who no longer play by them.  Our parents don't understand.  Not because they're bad people.  But because the world they grew up in  doesn't exist anymore.  And admitting that  would mean everything they believed in  was a lie.  So they deny it.  And in that denial,  they pass down our pain  as if it's our fault.  But we see it.  We feel it.  We know the truth:  Suffering is not noble.  Struggle is not sacred.  And survival is not the meaning of life.  There is enough.  Enough food.  Enough housing.  Enough wealth.  The only thing missing  is permission to share it.  They use the generational divide as a wedge.  Father against son.  Mother against daughter.  Because a divided people  is a controlled people.

For my entire adolescence, I held more left leaning views, despite growing up in a mostly conservative family.  2016 was the first time I was eligible to vote. The moment I heard Trump asking why we can't solve problems by using nukes. I thought Trump sounded insane, so obviously I wasn't gonna vote for the guy after hearing that. In the end during election night, my mother mistakenly told me I wasn't registered to vote, she was wrong, I was registered.  So I stayed home, and watched a documentary about Trump's upbringing, and that's when I had a sunken feeling in my chest. The nuke comments were already bad, but this doc revealed who he was as a person in a very detailed way. Believe me when I say, I was not happy when he won.  Between 2017 and 2020 I was dealing with a lot of stuff. Grieving after my father passed away, not having a job, and becoming chronically online as away to cope.  My political beliefs were still left leaning during 2017. But in 2019, that's when I got exposed to a lot of right leaning grifters, and slowly I started becoming more influenced by them.  By the end of 2019 I was terrified of women ruining my life, immigrants ruining the economy, and became extremely far right. My political views during this era were the complete opposite of what they used to be. I was spewing all kinds of hateful and bigoted stuff. Funny enough despite the right wing influence on me, I still didn't like Trump one bit during this point of my life.  Fast forward to the start of 2020. When I first heard about Covid, I knew right away it was bad news, and pleaded with my family to take safety measures during it. I think watching how Trump and the Republicans responded to the pandemic, helped to snap me out of it. They clearly didn't care one bit about the average person, and instead tried to gaslight everyone into thinking everything was fine when it wasn't.  After 2020, my political beliefs returned back to being left leaning again. When I look back on my views during 2019, I cringe.  I'm sharing my story, because I hope, the same thing can happen for others, who went down the far right rabbit hole.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1jr2bb5/i_think_there_might_be_hope_for_gen_z/", "date":"2025-04-04", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenZ", "sentiment":"positive"},

Here\u2019s my weird I guess incel or hate or whatever you may call it, moment in the past, which I\u2019m sharing to laugh about now. I was a senior in high school, known to some but not many. I felt like I was the world. I dated a girl who shared my interests, and we dated for three good years. After that relationship ended but with depression on my side, I guess I went through a phase of disliking women or feeling lonely and hate towards them. In high school, I had many opposite-sex friends, but now I have none, Maybe in 2023 or early 2024, I was in this chamber of hate, anger, and frustration with the system, I started to listen to other incel posts, to podcast bros or whatever at the time, hell maybe even Tate to agreeing with Trump. I felt like I deserved something, wealth or someone, but in reality, I didn\u2019t, I had to earn someone  by socializing (which I\u2019m still ass at and here I am on Reddit, at least I\u2019m not an incel)   Now, I\u2019ve broken out of that cycle of anger, hell only reason is I appiled my reasoning for reading every political book \"understanding the other side\". It took time, but many men or others in the US or around the world feel the same way. You lose something, and you want to take it out on whoever you feel responsible for. I understand it\u2019s frustrating, plus with the current economic, political, and social, you feel anger towards it, you vote for a populist that promises half bullshit in media and you think by voting for them all our problems will magically disappear. Anyways What got me curious is the gender war and what it means to be a man. Politics is my drug, and I love the data that\u2019s coming out of this war. Many of us men are being left behind in education, and we know we won\u2019t live up to our parents\u2019 wealth and be able to enjoy the American Dream. We\u2019re tired of dating culture, the cost of living, and other problems. Some of us are lonely and want to take it out on the world (well, not me, I guess), both genders are divergent from each other, almost similar to Korea as we see.  Hell I'm in my early 20s, go to the gym, play soccer, read up on political science books for fun in the past, watch anime, play games on steam and what not, but am I truly a man? Am I doing enough? I know I won\u2019t earn as much as my father or family, will I even have a chance to get married or afford a house, hell even provide that to my kids if. Even get married?   Anyway the question is, what does it mean to be a man in this decade or future? Are we doomed to be left behind, are we doomed economically? Are we so cooked in this dating culture where we will open an AI girlfriend or boyfriend lmao, is being a man associated with going to the gym like me? Working out or playing a sport to discipline? Is it to be religious like me a Muslim? What is the definition at this point?        maybe my idol man is Zidane combine with Robin Williams? lmao", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1jr1z90/what_does_it_mean_to_be_a_man_in_this_generation/", "date":"2025-04-04", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenZ", "sentiment":"neutral"},

Racism is just \"out-group derogation\", an instinctual tribalistic reaction to feeling threatened by another group. And yes this applies to and from all races.  First, a short intro to identity psychology:  In-Groups = Groups you identify with.  Out-Groups = Groups you don't identify with.  What we think of as racism is just \"out-group derogation\" Out-group derogation is a well documented behavior in humans. Essentially it is the act of putting down out-groups. Unfortunately all the evidence points to the fact that it is an instinctual thing. Not saying that racism is a part of human nature, but tribalism most certainly is.  But why do people feel the need to do this in the first place? What drives people to go out of their way to spread hatred against out-groups? The behavioral sciences hold the answer.  Racism, sexism, nationalism, religious conflict, etc, all revolve around out-group derogation. The cause of out-group derogation is distress, and the effect is a temporary relief/boost in self esteem for the person engaging in it.  If a person feels the need to be racist to X \"race\", it is more likely than not that they perceive X race as somehow being a threat to the power/influence/status of that person's race. Being racist, spreading racist propaganda/misinformation, even just casual racism, are all psychological defense mechanisms for this insecurity.

Because I know who I am. I know what I offer. I know what I am looking for. No one else has my fun, no one else has my intellect, no one else can offer exactly what I offer :)  I am one of a kind.

 {"id":2697, "title":"It really is because of that damn phone", "content":"I don't care how much I sound like a Gen X mom in this post. It IS that damn phone.  Modern teenagers spend [more than 7 hours a day](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/screen-time-for-teens) on screens. If you do the math, you'll find that [the average 18 year old will spend 93% of the free time in their life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TMPXK9tw5U) in front of a screen. Of course, pretty much no one *wants* to spend 93% of their free time on a screen, but these things are designed to be addictive. Social media companies have teams of the smartest neuroscientists in the world dedicated to keeping you addicted to YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit, and whatever else you like to include. Since our lawmakers are too incompetent to protect their citizens from these things, it's up to you to snatch back control over your time.  The effects from spending hours a day on your phone are strong and well documented. Studies have consistently shown for years that high screen time is [strongly correlated with increased anxiety, depression, loneliness, and all sorts of other issues](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10353947/). It's appalling that social media platforms can be used by *children* (or anyone else, honestly) when the implications of these platforms are known to be horrible. Social media for minors is completely unjust - it's setting up a fight between the willpower of a 15 year old, and a supercomputer designed by the smartest people on earth to keep you addicted. Who is going to win that fight? On average, for seven hours a day, the supercomputer wins.  Social media is also known for sending people down political pipelines that dump people on the extremes of both sides, and polarization is now higher than its been in decades, which makes sense when you consider your feed is specifically tailored to you. Remember the killing of the health insurance company leader, and how pretty much everyone online seemed to support it? Turns out, only [17% of Americans view that event favorably](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/17/united-healthcare-ceo-killing-poll). Extrapolate this example to other political issues and you get an idea of why we're so divided and why we're so shocked when our candidates don't win or our ideas prevail in the real world.  There's a reason why [more successful people spend less time on a screen](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2022-infographic-8-18-census-web-final-release_0.pdf) \\- high income earners are consistently the least affected by phones and social media. I've met only one person under 18 who has their own business, and I've also only met one person under 18 who chooses to use a burner phone instead of a smartphone. Guess what? They're the same person. Coincidence? I think NOT!  Also, I need to rant about how much people my age use their phones in public. It's genuinely sad. I take a couple classes for dual enrollment credit at a local technical college, and no one even talks to each other. Everyone's just on their phones all. The. Time. In my English class (which may have problems, but is still very fun and interesting considering it's English), half the class is openly on their phones for the entire lecture.  I've tried to talk to my classmates, but usually whenever I do, they give a one sentence response and then go back to scrolling on their phone. Like, really? This is the loneliest generation ever, so you'd think that people would welcome friendly interaction, especially since *I'm* doing the hardest move of starting the conversation, but nope. If I'm missing some key detail in these situations, feel free to tell me in the comments because I have no idea (and no, I am not ugly or dressed weird, you can rule that reason out).  \"Well maybe they just don't want to talk\" Sure, people don't have to talk to me, that's fine. But then I should see this trend with older adults, and I haven't seen that. I've yet to be in a place where people over 35 behave this way.  Just please, for the love of God, put your phone away in public unless you're actively making plans or doing something important. Even if you don't talk to anyone, and even if you just sit there, it's still so much better than being in front of a screen. Try it, at least once. Start a conversation with the old man in front of you on the train. Read a book if you're bored in class. Study the bulletin for nearby events while standing in line for coffee. You'll rediscover the world beyond your screen.  \"But what if I have social anxiety?\" Research suggests your phone is to blame for social anxiety in the first place. I'm not here to tell you exactly what will work for curing your social anxiety, but you know what *won't* work? Scrolling on your phone to avoid making eye contact with the person in front of you. Seriously, do *anything* else. I'd recommend a book if you still want to avoid interaction, and [reading books has a long list of benefits](https://www.piedmont.org/living-real-change/health-benefits-of-reading).  \"But I don't have energy for anything besides using my phone when I get home from school/work!\" You don't even need to have energy to do better things than scrolling TikTok. Literally sitting still and staring at a wall would be better for you than TikTok, Reddit, YouTube Shorts, or whatever you scroll on. At least a wall won't feed you misinformation. With any luck, you'll get bored of staring at the wall and be forced to do something interesting like go outside.  \"You have almost 100K Reddit karma, aren't you kind of a hypocrite?\" Yes, I am. We all are. I used to waste a pathetic amount of time on this platform, and even though I cut my time down considerably, I still have a big problem with screen time. I'm as much a victim of these tech companies as you are. I just hope to shed some light on what your phone and computer are doing to you.  If just one person quits Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, or just stops using their phone because of this post, I have done my job well. And if you want to be that one person, go, do it. Stop reading and start doing.  TLDR: Sorry, but that's not available here.

Patriot act level of government over reach and \"conservatives\" are not saying a damn thing because as the old saying goes \"people don't mind a dictatorship as long as they're aligned with them\".   I personally blame the atomization of peeps that got exacerbated during covid, the massive amount of conservative campaigning online and white women (not any other women they're mostly chill). By the way i like how conservatives are painting DEI as effective/defective progam that hired unqualified black people and activly neglecting the fact that it's white women who benefited the most. But what can ya can do, both political parties are full of hacks anyway who have no concern of doing what the people actually want them to do.   And honestly it's a shame because I felt like we're were getting close to having genuine unity and going past race and into character but MLK is gonna have to keep turning for like an extra 14 years in grave probably before he can properly rest easy.   And I understand that racism is gonna take a long time to recover from and peeps are gonna be racist for a long time but try to keep hate out of it. It's not okay to have prejudices, as easy as life would be to have a group of people who objectively suck and to pin all the blame on, It doesn't work that way sadly. More importantly that mentality doesn't really solve things acts more of a cope and more of a persuasion tactic more than anything.   Also fuck you if your racist with even seeing or interacting with other races (looking at you Midwesterners) atleast people who are racist and interact with other races have something to base it off of and not some boogey man propaganda. I know racism is mostly projecting negative stereotypes on races but please actually think for yourself!   I really hope that race relations don't get any worse because I believe we're all gonna be bickering with lower living standards pretty soon and letting rich people delegitmize our government and turning this country into Brazil 2 Wealth Disparity Boogaloo staring peter thiel, elon musk, jeff Bezos, and Donald j trump.

There was much more of a  social stigma for supporting Trump than there is now. In 2017 he was seen much more harshly by women and minorities as his 2016 electoral base was much smaller and less diverse than now. Trump and the GOP weren't seen as the party of \"cool people\" and of the \"youth\". Hip Hop and nearly all form of pop culture was strongly against Trump and still had alot of nostalgia for Obama. While the most edgy openly supported Trump they were largely seen as outcasts. YouTube in 2016 wasn't so infested with far right politics and it would have been weird to see a Republican congressman on a podcast/ just casually hanging out with YouTubers. Trump was getting posted around with memes and his outlandish tweets but they were largely just seen as a joke. Older Gen Z could also see Trump as more \"illegitimate\"  as he didn't win the popular vote. Fast forward to 2024 and Trump and the GOP are seen as \"cool,alpha, and for men\". Pop culture sees them more favorable and there on podcasts/YouTube. These attitudes for the GOP didn't exist in 2016 and 2020. Younger Gen Z also have no memories of a normal GOP candidate such as Mitt Romney, so there understanding is politics is always a chaotic circus. There is a generational divide in how Gen Z views the Trump era and I think it will be important in 2028 and the next decade or so. Younger Gen Z will likely view him more favorably, as they are also not going to be adults during most of his presidency. Also never faced as strong social stigma for supporting him, and have no memory of a strong democrat leader such as Obama.   Edit:For a factual analysis, the 2024 Gen Z vote was much more pro Trump than in 2020 or 2016. This means new first time young voters swung hard for Trump. Sure Gen Z overall could have moved right but a swing like that is impossible without a new electorate(for such a small voter base) Shift between Gen Z men from 2020 to 2024 was 15 points.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1jol04k/there_is_a_generational_divide_for_how_we_see/", "date":"2025-04-01", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenZ", "sentiment":"neutral"},

The UK got a labour government, and Germany was able to keep the AfD out of government (for now), but the US has turned hard-right.

What this story tells us is that the voter DEMANDS improvements in their standard of living year-on-year or else they\u2019ll vote into office a gaggle of hard-right nutjobs to revert society to feudalism. The issue is that those kinds of improvements might be simply impossible for advanced economies in the 21st century under any government.

Dating seems like a massive uphill battle while everything else in my life has come pretty easily, wondering what to do.  I work a decent white collar job, have plenty of disposable income, taking exams at a very fast pace in order to get credentialed in my field (where most pay increases come from). Everything good there.   Tons of time spent on hobbies. Playing pickleball 2-3 times a week, getting some exercise in all 7 days a week most of the time. Lost 8 pounds, trying to lose 15ish more (but already started at a healthy weight, just slimming down to try to get back into intense running). Bowling a league once a week, have bowled very well the last two months. Coaching youth bowling on Saturdays, have pretty good rapport with the kids now, that\u2019s been fun. Good relationship with my parents, see them often. Made a lot of new friends here and have people to do stuff with. Still in touch with most of my college friends. Traveling out of state once a month.  And yet it doesn\u2019t feel like enough. I\u2019m occasionally lonely. I want to date, but am getting nowhere. I rarely ever run into single women in my day to day life. I might get two matches a month off apps and very rarely get a date. I have limited experience, and don\u2019t know exactly who all I\u2019d be compatible with, and it seems hard to figure out without getting actual experience. It seems to be draining me some. I\u2019ll put effort in on apps, get nowhere, share struggles with friends and talk about how hard it seems to be. Yet if I just totally detach from trying to put effort in how would I know it\u2019s time to try again? I don\u2019t have a personality type that lends itself to having relationships just fall into my lap. It\u2019s seemingly going to take effort at some point. But what type of effort?

What I came up with almost sounds like lecturing a child about death and mortality\u2014and how to stop focusing on the negativity of it. It's no surprise that many guys nowadays find it hard to attract women.  I personally believe this is largely due to the internet and social media inflating physical standards for both men and women. I think parents need to tell their sons the cold, hard truth: the idea of simply meeting a girl, falling in love, and building a family is going to be very difficult to achieve. But instead of obsessing over that, there are so many other things in life they can focus on.  I\u2019m only sharing this advice because it\u2019s what I did for myself. Whenever I started feeling down about my inability to attract or date women, I shifted my focus to other things in my life\u2014like my dream of building a successful business, traveling the world, maybe even going to space, writing my own book, creating a comic book with an original character and universe, or making a video game. I know that might sound delusional, but focusing on those goals instead of my dating problems actually led me to stop caring so much about whether women were attracted to me or not.  All I\u2019m saying is, parents need to stop selling delusions to their sons. They should be honest about the realities of dating and attraction, but also teach them that life is about much more than that\u2014and there are other meaningful things they can pursue that will bring them happiness.

A lot of the conventional media would present news or write articles in a monotonous tone and reading news doesn\u2019t seem fun. Plus a lot of the media outlets lately have been hella negative. One example article of the new app could be something like this:  \u201cBRUH MOMENT: Chinese Space Nerds Set Fire to Match in Space and WTF Happens Next Will Make You Spit Your Drink \ud83d\udc80 In a totally batshit crazy move that would make even Elon Musk go \"hold my beer,\" some absolute madlads on China's Tiangong space station decided to fuck around and find out what happens when you light a match in space. Like, imagine being so bored floating around in your space pajamas that you're like \"you know what would slap right now? ARSON.\" It's giving the same energy as that kid in science class who always wanted to mix random chemicals together just to see what would explode. This is basically the space equivalent of that time Florida Man tried to microwave a watermelon filled with lighter fluid - except these dudes are government-funded geniuses and not some rando hopped up on bath salts. No word yet on whether they tried to roast marshmallows afterward or if this is just China's way of flexing on NASA like \"yeah, we're out here lighting matches while y'all still freaking out about toilet paper getting loose in zero-g.\"   Would y\u2019all like something like this? And if built correctly with funny articles would you download it?

I despise him. Today my mum asked me why the chargeable fan wasn't plugged in and I told her that maybe my tutor had unplugged it. She asked me why he would do that and I said to hit us. She asked my younger sister if this is true and she confirmed it. I knew what I was doing. I acted so innocent so that she thought I didn't know what he was doing was wrong. She sent all of us out of her room so that she could make a call. When we left there was a storm in my parents' bedroom. He comes on Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays so if he doesn't come on Thursday then I'll know he got fired. I hate this man so much. He beats my 4 year old brothers even when they read and when they cry he tells them to shut up before he gives a second beating. My sister always tells me to keep quiet for some reason. I'll update on Thursday.   Edit: I forgot to edit sry. He wasn't fired. I don't know why. I think it might be because my dad uses violence as punishment as well so he has no problem with my teacher hitting us. My mum might hit us on occasion but that's like if you crash her car or smth and she would never lay her hand on somebody's child since her aunt abused her as a child.

Lately in my house and generally seeing people in restaurants and in public, I\u2019ve noticed that the tables have turned. My dad is bringing his laptop to the table while eating with the family to listen to his podcasts and stuff while my mom is scrolling on her Facebook. I feel out of place and powerless in these situations because I know if I tell them to put their tech away and talk they are gonna be fussy. Back to my point about in public, the adults in restaurants are on their phones almost always while the alphas and young Z\u2019s are socializing and chatting, I\u2019ve pointed this out multiple times with my friends and we all have come to the same general consensus; Our parents are the problem generation, not us. Yet they still blame every problem I have to be \u201cbecause of that damn phone\u201d   TLDR: it\u2019s sucks to be the one to tell your parents to get off the phone in the car, dinner table, and telling them to turn it down.

 {"id":3595, "title":"Words to correct history", "content":"Just to make sure y'all know what \"aura\" actually is.  Let's start from this: We gen z populized the term aura.  I've been hearing kids using that word, including other words populized by us. Especially nowadays when y'all are creating new word combinations like \"aura farming\", I'm starting to fear y'all are forgetting the original meaning behind certain words. For example, I just heard a 2010's kid explaining the word aura and realized some of y'all definitely has the wrong idea.   So I'm here to correct history.    As 2000's kids, we've seen the world before ours, we've shaped the world we were born into, and we've seen how it transformed into the meme world y'all are living in. So if there's someone who knows the true origin behind words, it's us. And here's what \"aura\" actually is:  It isn't someone being cool.  Aura is energy field around living beings. Basically came from hinduism where it is believed that people got \"chakras\". Basically Naruto but without magic (almost). This is simplified explanation but chakras emits spiritual energy fields which surrounds the individuals it's coming from, creating \"aura\".  It's essentially just yoga science but basically the healthier life you got, the more powerful your chakras are and the \"cleaner\" are your aura. That's the concept. Anime adapts the concept in a way where aura basically measures the power of person's mana: aura is still magical field but measures how much mana they got or can emit. Basically how powerful they are. Because of this, aura has been used as a way to show off the character's power. A character might emit an aura so powerful, other characters are able to feel it and gets intimidated.   Now, since TikTok popularized anime, people started seeing edits of anime characters emitting aura (magical fields around them). Usually, clips of them showing their aura are the moments when they're doing something cool, like Rimuru walking on dead bodies mad as hell and emitting serious level of aura (again, magical field around his body). The trend populized the term \"aura\" but as the time goes on, people new to the trend (with no prior knowledge on aura or anime in general) took the word aura as the concept of coolness by itself. But as I said, aura isn't someone being cool and it's about time someone came to fix this info.   When someone says \"look at his aura\" or \"he got a lot of aura\", it originally meant the power field the person is emitting in general. The feeling he is emitting as you're looking at him. Aura isn't him being cool, it's the feeling you got of him being cool. And not the feeling you're getting exactly but to be precise, it's the effect he's having on other people, making them think he's cool.  For example, Naruto appearing on giant frogs in the middle of the battle field is not aura. People thinking he is cool is not aura. It's the effect Naruto has on people that is aura. It's the power field emitting from him that is aura.   Life example: Your dad walking into a room after hearing you made your mom cry is not aura. You getting scared of him is not aura. The aura is the emotional/spiritual energy emitting from him that makes you fear him and makes you think he's gonna beat you up. Aura is not the person nor what people thinks of the person. Aura is the effect itself the person has on other people, making them think he is cool. Aura is energy. Aura is vibe.   I hope this clears misconceptions some of you got on the meaning behind the word. I know most of you are forever gonna think aura = being cool but as long as at least one of you knows the truth, my soul can rest in peace. May the ancient knowledge shows light to those who seek the truth.", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenAlpha/comments/1jdxd7s/words_to_correct_history/", "date":"2025-03-18", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenAlpha", "sentiment":"neutral"},

When I was in 2nd grade, I thought it was funny to pull on girls' back-pockets (which I called \"butt-pockets\" back then) so I did that plenty of times.  There was a middle school attached to my Elementary school that year, so that morning, before I went inside to go upstairs to my class, I talked with a pair of middle school women briefly who were walking towards their school. They were in 7th or 8th grade, and I don't remember what I talked about. Then I ended the conversation by pulling on both of their back-pockets and laughing, then as soon as I went inside the front door, the janitor told me in the foyer that he had just seen me \"pinch\" their back-pockets so he'd go upstairs to let my teacher know. I begged him not to, and he wouldn't budge, and told me I'd better hurry to class so I don't get a tardy remark on my class's student record.  A couple minutes after I got to my 2nd grade class, the custodian appeared right outside our door, then asked my teacher to come out to the hall, then narced on me for pulling on a pair of older girls' back-pockets. For that, I got my name on the board as a sanction for what I've done.  The pair of middle schoolers only went \"Ooh!\" and walked faster in the other direction to their school right after I pulled on their back-pockets.  But if a 2nd grader were to do that to a pair of middle school gals in 2025, would their reactions be different? What would happen differently?", "link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/GenAlpha/comments/1j9fxtp/to_the_middle_school_women_of_rgenalpha_if_a/", "date":"2025-03-12", "image_url":"None", "generation":"GenAlpha", "sentiment":"neutral"},
